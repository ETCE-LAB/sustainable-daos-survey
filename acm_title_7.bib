abstract = {Over the recent years, there has been an intense research on blockchain and its applications in real-life scenarios, both from academic and industrial research. This paper proposes an architecture for a blockchain-based marketplace platform. We have implemented and tested our design, which allows user to do simple marketplace transactions as well as more complicated features, such as auctions \`{a} la eBay. We explore the functionalities and the implementation details of our solution, while showing how we ensure respect with GDPR.},

abstract = {Sustainability is a topic of increasing interest. The United Nations has released a list of 17 goals for sustainable development for the global community. Blockchain is a recent technological innovation that shows great promise in changing industries. In this paper, we look specifically at smart grids and supply chain management systems as areas where sustainable technological innovation can happen. To identify software engineering aspects of blockchain in smart grids and supply chain management, we start upon online libraries focusing on engineering and information technology, and we opted for the methodology of systematic mapping studies in software engineering. The search strategy identified 535 papers, of which 60 were identified as main studies for our mapping. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous similar studies exist. Results of the study show that the research connecting blockchain technology to smart grids and supply chain management systems is still young. None of the techniques or systems have yet been implemented in a real life setting. As such, more work has to be done before we can look at the actual implications of putting such technologies into use. Software engineering practices could prove to be very useful in the process of development. We propose that future studies can focus on bringing the technologies closer to real life implementations, as well as how to involve the end users in the development of the blockchain-based systems.},

abstract = {Software sustainability is a systematic challenge that impacts broad segments of software systems. Software codebases must evolve overtime to address changing contexts and adapt to the flux in middlewares and platforms. In the process, it accumulates arbitrary complexities and its maintenance becomes progressively difficult.Current sustainability approaches focus on the symptoms and tend to be reactive in nature, and ignore the fundamental incentive structures that drive decision-making processes. Moreover, contemporary approaches are insensitive to the uniqueness of each software project context and operate on the assumption that sustainability measurements are universally applicable to the majority of software systems.This paper introduces a fundamentally novel peer-driven approach to managing software sustainability. The methodology ensures that software teams can define their own sustainability measures that adequately address the unique context of their project and its priorities. These measures are dynamically defined by the project peers to ensure their applicability as the project context evolves. Finally, the paper introduces Susereum, a blockchain platform that materializes the methodology and establishes novel incentive structures to systematically promote software sustainability throughout the project lifecycle.},

abstract = {Blockchain networks have been claimed to have the potential of fundamentally changing the way humans perform economic transactions with each other. In such networks, trust-enabling agents and activities, that were traditionally arranged in a centralized fashion, are replaced by a network of nodes which collectively yet independently witness and establish the non-repudiability of transactions. Most often, a proof-of-work (PoW) requirement ensures that participants invest resources for joining the network, incentivizing conformance to the network rules, while making it highly infeasible for malicious agents to construct an alternative version of the transaction history. While research on security and efficiency aspects of blockchain networks is already being conducted, there is still work to be done to understand how different external and internal conditions guarantee or threaten their sustainability, i.e., their continuous operation. Focusing on public PoW-based blockchain platforms, in this paper we sketch an abstract model that is aimed at supporting comprehension and qualitative reasoning about the factors that affect sustainability of a blockchain network.},

abstract = {With a spectacular boom in blockchain technologies at various verticals and with the increase in renewable energy penetration, these could solve one of the major issues in Power Systems - Energy Demand Management by the utilities. Blockchain being a distributed architecture, it could fit into the deregulated energy market to enable energy trading in a self sustainable energy community and manage the power demands among the community members. As proof of concept, the blockchain technology is introduced in a smart community where consumers take part in energy trading among themselves as well as with the utility. In this paper, three use cases for P2P energy trading in a private blockchain network is discussed. The blockchain architecture is developed using the Hyperledger framework and the smart contracts are defined in the chaincode. The performance of the blockchain network on resource constrained IoT system based on Raspberry Pi is also evaluated.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technology (DLT) like blockchain technology (BCT) is expected to have the power to improve sustainability in supply chains. To summarize and organize the insights of research in information systems (IS) on how BCT relates to transparency and, ultimately, sustainability of supply chains, this paper conducts a structured literature review. In total 46 articles have been identified and analyzed. The analysis shows that the potential of BCT to facilitate transparency in supply chains and thus enable sustainability measures stems from its decentralized and distributed nature. Further, BCT does not unfold this potential on its own; rather it is a technology that complements existing IS used to manage inter-organizational transactions. Overall, the paper contributes to the literature by providing a deeper insight into the possibilities, features, and merits of BCT in the SCM context, mainly focusing on transparency and sustainability matters. Summarizing and organizing the advantages of BCT and the shortcomings of existing IS used in SCM as discussed in prior research, this paper emphasizes that BCT needs to be considered as a complementary technology. Viewing BCT as such and implementing at such, BCT has great potential to support sustainability efforts significantly.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are recently gaining wide adoption since the introduction of Bitcoin, being distributed, authority-free, and secure. Proof of Work (PoW) is at the heart of blockchain's security, asset generation, and maintenance. Although simple and secure, a hash-based PoW like Bitcoin's puzzle is often referred to as "useless'', and the used intensive computations are considered "waste'' of energy. A myriad of Proof of "something'' alternatives have been proposed to mitigate energy consumption; however, they either introduced new security threats and limitations, or the "work'' remained far from being really "useful''. In this work, we introduce Proof of eXercise (PoX): a sustainable alternative to PoW where an eXercise is a real world matrix-based scientific computation problem. We provide a novel study of the properties of Bitcoin's PoW, the challenges of a more "rational'' solution as PoX, and we suggest a comprehensive approach for PoX.},
