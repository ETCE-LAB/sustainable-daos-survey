It is, therefore, important that we understand the impact of those initiatives in terms of circular economy objectives. This chapter gives an overview of the current smart city concept and definitions, and of the definitions related to the smart sustainable city and the advantage of the implementation of smart sustainable city instead of the smart city concept. Furthermore, the chapter addresses the impact of smart sustainable city initiatives in promoting sustainability and the circular economy (CE), particularly in the water and waste water-management, waste-management, and energy sectors. A number of use cases are presented of solutions that have been adopted, using technologies such as IoT-enabled devices, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, to enable the transition toward a circular economy and resource efficiency in a smart sustainable city, and the effects of these solutions are discussed.}

However, limited studies have critically examined the technology's role in advancing sustainability. Drawing on the literature on sustainability-oriented innovation and innovation resistance theory, we explore the potential of blockchain technology to contribute to sustainable transformations within food supply chains. We reflect on 18 expert interviews with various actors across global food supply chains to evaluate the opportunities for, and resistance to, Blockchain technology as a driver of sustainability. The findings reveal that Blockchain is used within food supply chains as both a tool for sustainability as well as a broader philosophical mindset for addressing sustainability challenges. We reveal the opportunities for Blockchain technology as a sustainability-oriented innovation that can ensure fairer supply chains, enhance food traceability, and drive environmental sustainability. We also unpack the resistance to Blockchain that hinder its potential as a sustainability-oriented innovation which include functional and psychological barriers alongside cooperative barriers and protection of the status quo. Our study contributes to the broader literature on sustainability-oriented innovation and innovation resistance theory.}

However, the exiting consensus algorithms suffer from performance bottleneck such as low throughput, high delay, unstable performance, sustainability issues and vulnerability to targeted attacks. In this paper, we propose a new consortium blockchain consensus algorithm, referred to as Weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerance (WBFT) consensus algorithm that improves system throughput and consensus delay. We introduce a dynamic weighting mechanism for consensus nodes, which enhances the security of blockchain system by weakening the influence of malicious nodes and reduces the probability of malicious behavior. We validate the performance of WBFT experimentally and compare it against Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Reputation-Based Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (RBFT) based approaches. The results show that WBFT substantially outperforms PBFT and RBFT in terms of system throughput, consensus delay and security.}

In this study, we discuss in order to eliminate the problems experienced in the energy grid management process, the blockchain concept, and its integration with renewable energy systems. First, we develop a novel integration process of blockchain with the renewable energy systems under the circular economy perspective in order to ensure the sustainability of energy grid management systems, followed by discussions on the advantages of the proposed integration process for energy policy makers. Second, the challenges of blockchain faced during the integration to a circular economy are presented. In order to prioritize the challenges encountered in the integration process, a numerical analysis is conducted using the Pythagorean Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process method based on expert opinions, and corresponding managerial implications are included.}

We identify that when the blockchain adoption cost exceeds a threshold, the entry can be blocked by mandatory blockchain adoption and the incumbent enjoys the monopoly position; when the blockchain adoption cost falls into an intermediate range, deterrence needs not only the use of blockchain technology but also price distortion by the incumbent; when the blockchain adoption cost is sufficiently low, the incumbent must compete with the entrant because blockchain technology is no longer effective for deterrence. Moreover, we examine how government intervention (tariff or subsidy) affects LSPE and find that both tariff and subsidy schemes can enhance the value of adopting blockchain technology to prevent LSPE. If the blockchain adoption cost is moderate, then levying tariffs on LSPE can achieve an economic and environment-dominating outcome, but the subsidy scheme cannot. Our findings provide managerial insights for cross-border supply chain managers and offer guidance to policy makers who design trade policies.}

Sustainable supply chain visibility is premised on sharing of mutually benefiting information, to achieve associated sustainability objectives including those related to economic, environmental and social goals. Sustainable supply chains strive for distinctive visibility with its attendant benefits that include improving and strengthening the supply chain for competitive advantage. Advances in technology such as blockchain technology can help facilitate effective management of sustainable supply chain visibility and in delivering associated benefits. The relational characteristics of blockchain and sustainable supply chain visibility has recently been reported in the literature with some emphasis on the capacity, capability and context of sustainable supply chain visibility. This paper explores a notion of context-awareness and blockchain in relation to sustainable supply chain visibility. A landscape for an architecture of a blockchain-based sustainable supply chain visibility management platform centred on context-awareness is suggested. The main thrust of the considerations is provisioning of secure, auditable and mutually benefiting sustainable supply chain information sharing, for distinctive visibility, in heterogeneous context-aware scenarios whilst recognising the underlying characteristics of sustainable supply chain visibility.}

We analyze multiple case studies of blockchain projects implemented in supply chains in developing countries to assess product quality, environmental accounting and social impact measurement. We have developed seven propositions, which describe how blockchain can help address a number of challenges various stakeholders face in promoting sustainable supply chains in developing countries. The challenges that the propositions deal with include those associated with an unfavorable institutional environment, high costs, technological limitations, unequal power distribution among supply chain partners and porosity and opacity of value delivery networks.}

abstract = {The textile sector accounts for the fourth-highest usage of primary raw materials and water (after food, housing, and transport), the second-highest usage of land, and the fifth highest Green House Gases (GHG) emissions (EEA, 2017). While Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been widely used to assess the environmental impact of fashion, most studies are constrained by the lack of reliable data. Blockchain technology may enable better traceability by making origin and journey more transparent. The potential to integrate LCA and blockchain has been discussed in other sectors, but specific protocols in the fashion sector are largely missing. This study aims to address this by a) exploring the use of LCA to measure the impact reduction potential of circular strategies and b) proposing a protocol for the integration of LCA and BC to accurately assess circular practices. Using leather handbags as a case study, an LCA study is conducted comparing two circular scenarios against a baseline to quantify potential benefits from circular strategies. Subsequently, it builds a blockchain-based LCA framework to unleash circularity opportunities through enhanced traceability and data sharing. Results point to substantial environmental benefits from the circular strategies, for example, circular scenario 2 (reuse markets/second-hand leather bag) was estimated to cause between 34.8\% and 53.8\% lower impacts while circular scenario 1 (leather alternative) contributed to impact reduction of more than 35\% of the impacts in most impact categories (10 out of 18). The results also highlight the contribution of blockchain technology to enable traceability and reliable data for identification of environmental hotspots and accurate quantification of circular potential.}

We put forward a policy framework that can potentially address these three questions and in addition could represent a critical step towards a circular economy eliminating the need for a post-resource discussion. Using precious metals as an example, we present a novel concept that combines policy, business and technological aspects aimed at making efficient use of finite resources and distributing the revenue more evenly. This approach could hence create jobs and eliminate the need of a post-resource discussion for post-industrial economies. Moreover, we will illustrate herein how this approach could be the initial step of the leapfrogging to a post-resource economy with maximized employment. Furthermore, the advance of some emerging technologies, such as block chain and associated smart contracts could be leveraged to track the primary asset being leased. We also note the broader impact on sustainability and economics with the implications of such a model in driving a circular economy, encouraging GDP growth, addressing resource “scarcity” and on the environment.}

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the integration barriers of Blockchain Technology (BCT) within Circular Food Supply Chains (CFSCs) towards firm’s operational effectiveness through a multi-methodological process. Initially the integration barriers are identified through a review of literature and these risks are categorised, using evidence obtained by survey questionnaire completed by experts in the integrated research arena. A further quantified prioritisation of these barriers is made by utilizing a Fuzzy Delphi approach, validated by expert practitioners drawn from the food production and supply organizations. Finally, through semi-structured interviews with Blockchain and FSC experts, an examination of how the integration barriers affect operational effectiveness may be mitigated is provided. This paper concludes that the identified barriers to blockchain integration have real impact on the operational effectiveness of the firm that can only be clarified through industry wide standardised processes.}

This is important as the rising demand for such technology enabled platforms has been found to be necessary for fulfilling the opt for e-commerce services to support the retail outlets. The literature shows that to relax the pressure on the last mile sector, blockchain technology can be an effective solution both to protect the firm financial aspects and sustainability requirements. To ensure efficiency in the system and success in the implementation of blockchain technology into the last mile delivery sector, it is essential to study the various factors and capabilities of blockchain to handle the existing problems and requirements to analyze the efficiency of this integration. The focus areas of this paper are mainly to identify the impact of applying blockchain technology to support the last mile delivery of goods. The impacted areas focus mainly on the efficiency of the process and its leverage on the costs, both administrative and operational, and level of sustainability achieved. The proposed platform has enabled the enhancement of the integration of blockchain into the last mile delivery. The proposed smart contract system is designed to efficiently assign the orders from the demander to the respective fleet providers with the help of miners. This assignment is made possible by considering the various aspects that have been stored into the system, namely geographical location, the proximity to the destination of delivery along the route of delivery, size of the parcels, and capacity of the fleet.}

However, actors have little information available to guide sustainable consumption decisions beyond simple labels. Blockchain technology can potentially alleviate the numerous sustainability problems related to agro-food commodity supply-chains by fostering traceability and transparency. Despite significant research on blockchain, there is limited understanding of the concrete barriers and benefits and potential applications of blockchain in real-world settings. Here, we present a case study of blockchain implementation in a coffee supply-chain. Our aim is to assess the potential of blockchain technology to promote sustainability in coffee supply chains through increased traceability and transparency and to identify barriers and opportunities for this. While our pilot implementation clearly illustrates certain benefits of blockchain, it also suggests that blockchain is no silver bullet for delivering agro-food supply chain sustainability. Knowledge on provenance and transparency of information on quality and sustainability can help trigger transformation of consumer behaviour, but the actual value lies in digitising the supply chain to increase efficiency and reduce costs, disputes, and fraud, while providing more insight end-to-end through product provenance and chain-of-custody information. We identify a need to understand and minimize supply chain barriers before we can reap the full benefits of digitalization and decentralization provided by blockchain technology.}

Our objective in this study is to explore the role of traceability in the transition to sustainability-driven circular agri-food supply chains. We employ an end-to-end supply chain investigation, using a consumer-focused survey and a Delphi study of supply chain stakeholders from farm to shelf. Our results suggest that traceability plays a pivotal role in this process. The acceptance of traceability systems begins with the consumer and moves upstream, from fork to farm, acting as a catalyst through stakeholders' adoption towards a circular economy. A change at the consumer level drives changes in the supply chain and eventually at the company level. This study is the first to introduce a traceability angle to the current literature on sustainable agri-food supply chains and its transition to the circular economy.}

Carbon markets could hasten climate change mitigation by driving investment towards efficient decarbonization activities, but they face problems around trust, transparency, and uptake. Blockchain offers a foundational technology upon which new carbon markets can be built which address these shortcomings. This sector is still nascent, fragmented, and clouded by technology hype, all of which obscures objective judgement of its performance and suitability. Here, we survey the current blockchain ecosystem, identifying 39 organizations that are developing blockchain solutions for carbon markets across four use cases: emissions-trading schemes, voluntary carbon markets, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). We develop and apply a technology readiness level (TRL) scale, and we find that most projects are still proofs of concept (TRL ≤ 3); however, one system has now reached maturity (TRL 9).

abstract = {Earth’s capacity to sustain mankind is reaching a tipping point. Packaging waste is one of the critical problems that is leading to such a situation and a focus of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. However, large multinational enterprises look at their products and its packaging in a separate way, which leads them to think that when the product is consumed, their responsibility ends, leaving the government to deal with the issue of managing the packaging waste. Due to the complexity of the issue and the fact that this is particularly problematic in emerging markets, we used an in-depth and longitudinal case study analysis. We found that there were a desire and ability, with the use of the right technology, among urban groups to tackle the problem if with the right incentives to the different involved actors and from a holistic perspective. Our findings allowed us to advance a holistic framework based on incentives by using digitalization and new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence. Doing so, we advance the theory in the circular economy by enhancing it with the use of new technologies and advance a resources value loop that adds to the product life cycle theory.}

However, how to enable the transparency and sustainability of supply chain through blockchain technology is indeed a complex decision-making problem. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, this paper develops a hierarchical enablers framework for improving sustainable supply chain transparency (SSCT) by blockchain technology in the cocoa industry. Then, the best-worst method (BWM) is used to evaluate the weights of main enablers and sub-enablers by a real case of cocoa supply chain in an emerging African economy. The case results indicate the most important main enabler is “Technical Characteristics”, and the top three sub-enablers are: “blockchain smart contract”, “blockchain security,” and “tracking product components”, respectively. The framework and method of this study can help decision-makers and supply chain managers develop strategies to promote the effective application of blockchain to improve SSCT. As far as we know, this paper is one of the first studies to evaluate blockchain's enablers for SSCT, especially in the context of African emerging economies.}

We collect data on 85 such applications and describe the empirical distributions of different attributes of these applications. In a logit regression, we analyze which application-specific and blockchain-specific characteristics determine the success of an application in the sense of an advanced operational status. We find evidence that applications of the type “energy trading” exhibit reduced chances of success, while green blockchain-based applications implementing a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism are more likely to become operational. Moreover, pursuing an initial coin offering has no significant effect on the success of an application. Our work provides the basis for a better understanding of the success factors of this new technology.}

Despite a growing body of research on blockchain-based technologies, the relationship between these two mechanisms for supply chains remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims at addressing this research gap and explaining their interaction. We described and assessed 16 cases of blockchain-based technologies and voluntary sustainability standards against twelve sustainability-related assessment criteria. The results show that the relationship between blockchain-based technologies and voluntary sustainability standards can be co-existing, synergistic, and antagonistic. While most cases fall under the co-existing relationship, we identified a few cases with synergistic relationships, and one case with an antagonistic relationship. We explain each type of relation and show how the system architecture and goal of a blockchain-based technology implementation are key determinants of this relationship. This study can support stakeholders in agro-food supply chain in better understanding the application of blockchain-based technologies for sustainability governance in relation to existing voluntary sustainability standards. It can further inform those stakeholders of possibilities to constructively collaborate and focus on positive social and environmental impacts within agro-food supply chains.}

Since building is the key facility in the city, smart building (SB) plays an important role in smart city. With the development of new AI technology and expansion of clients’ demand, smart buildings spread gradually in cities. Thereby, amounts of edge devices are accessed to the City IoT leading to the computation resources explosion and security issues in the smart environment. Here, we study the security of the data sensing in smart IoT and propose a novel data aggregation scheme, named Fog-based Anonymous Reward Data Aggregation scheme (later referred to as FARDA), to preserve the user privacy for developing a sustainable City IoT system. Specifically, this proposed scheme merges the AI based blockchain for enhancing the security on the edge devices and fog computing for the energy sustainability. More, FADRA attracts mobile sensing users and fog nodes by an anonymous reward mechanism in the blockchain framework. The framework leverages the provable Monero’s blockchain to endow two privacy requirements: (i) unlinkability between the payer’s address and the payee’s address and (ii) the non-traceability of the transaction sources. Moreover, two PKCs in the blockchain guarantee the benefits of sensing data participants theoretically. We verify the security properties of FARDA in theory and evaluate the efficiency for data sensing in smart environments on smartphones by experiments. Our study paves a way for broad researches on sustainable IoT in smart scenarios.}

Customers who want their products to be authenticated for sustainability put pressure on Original Equipment Manufacturers and suppliers to become more sustainable on a global scale. Moreover, social sustainability issues have become more challenging to address, and a growing number of stakeholders put emphasis on societal concerns. To this end, decision-makers are becoming increasingly interested in applying disruptive technologies to address societal, environmental, and economic concerns and accomplish sustainability goals. Researchers argue that disruptive technologies such as blockchain may be implemented to assist supply chains towards building sustainability. However, our literature analysis concluded that existing research has not quantitatively examined the critical functions of sustainable supply chain (SSC) for blockchain applicability using a decision framework. Therefore, this research, through Fuzzy SWARA-COPRAS-EDAS and COPELAND-based framework, is aimed at investigating the most feasible functions of a SSC for potential blockchain implementations. Using this framework, the critical functions of a SSC were ranked against the benefits of blockchain. The findings of this study implied that while sourcing, delivery, transformation and product recovery proved to be the most appropriate functions of SSCs for blockchain applications, customers and product use was the least feasible one. This study aids decision-makers in gaining a more thorough understanding of where in a SSC blockchain may create additional value.}

A blockchain allows for a fast, secure, and accessible information network by providing a decentralized ledger where materials and products can be traced to their sources. This paper investigates blockchain as a promising technology for the facilitation of a CE in the built environment. In support of this, a blockchain model is presented and tested through a synthetic case study to provide a proof of concept as to the feasibility of blockchain as an enabler of a CE in the built environment. With utilization of a blockchain, the current state of each material and component can be tracked, making the proactive planning for their reusability a tangible reality. The findings of the synthetic case study reveal that a blockchain can provide full material and energy traceability, enabling the user to make predictions for the recycling and reuse of materials and goods used in the built environment. Blockchain is shown to be a feasible and novel approach for employing CE concepts in the built environment domain. Additionally, the framework presented here could be beneficial for smart cities and communities, where a blockchain style of information flow can produce synergy with other aspects of a smart and connected community.}

To increase alliance performance, organizations in a strategic alliance are more likely to interpret each other’s equivocal behaviors in a positive way to sustain the stability of the relationship. Different from traditional mechanisms to build interorganizational trust, blockchain facilitates trust among alliance partners via its technology advantages, for example, public ledger and distributed consensus. The decentralized and distributed nature of a blockchain-based system assures that no single organization can add information to the chain without an approval from the alliance, nor can it make unilateral changes in the system. Drawing from the Affordance Theory, we propose an exploratory research design to understand the structure of a blockchain-based system, as well as how this blockchain-based system influences interorganizational trust in a strategic alliance and how blockchain-enabled interorganizational trust influences alliance performance. The case studies of two eastern banks indicate that the technical features of blockchain can help reduce equivocal behaviors and improve interorganizational trust. We discuss the findings and conclude the paper with implications.}

The SC works in a global market in which consumers are located worldwide and subject to traceability issues that can create distrust of the product quality. This issue can be resolved by implementing blockchain technology which provides benefits in terms of high traceability along with low transaction costs. However, blockchain negatively impacts the environment because of their high energy consumption. Therefore, in this study, we capture the trade-offs between traceability and sustainability for blockchain adoption by characterizing a game theory model. Our findings show that high levels of distrust pushes firms to avoid the implementation of blockchain. In such circumstances, blockchain is not sufficient to make consumers recognize the product quality and trust the firms’ practices. In contrast, low levels of distrust can make blockchain an economically suitable technology conditioned to minimal environmental damages; otherwise, firms need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between distrust and sustainability. Since the adoption of blockchain leads to an increase in prices and decrease of distrust, two factors determine whether to pursue this technology or not: low consumer sensitivity to price and high sensitivity to quality. In this study, we develop three specific cases where we model: 1) the direct impact of blockchain on distrust, 2) a stochastic distrust term, and 3) a Stackelberg game. Each case confirms our results and strengthens the robustness of our findings.}

abstract = {Power systems are undergoing rapid transitions to incorporate renewable sources of generation and to combat climate change. The next stage of transitions will lead to a shift from large-scale, centralized systems to networks of small-sized, distributed electricity systems, which require distributed or decentralized ledgers for database management for efficient transactions. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) are a form of decentralized ledgers where the transactions (energy, information, and money) among various entities are maintained. One such DLT is blockchain technology which offers several advantages. Data recorded in blockchains are difficult to tamper with; have privacy protection; facilitate fast, accurate, and real-time settlement of financial transactions. Contemporary research has started focusing on their possible applications in energy systems. State-of-the-art suggests that while business and market aspects have been extensively discussed, the electrical constraints and implementation methodologies have not been adequately addressed. Furthermore, all the reviewed projects have implemented only peer-to-peer transactions that are not scalable. To incorporate the new entities like prosumers, inter-microgrid transactions, and interactions with the legacy power grid, new structural and operational frameworks are necessary. The proposed research explores the possibility of developing blockchain enabled smart microgrids (BSMG) with the above frameworks. It aims to build a conceptual framework of BSMG, including the transaction protocols and process flows. It proposes the inclusion of network constraints in a three-level transaction setup executed over a four-layered architecture. Another practical challenge is that BSMGs may be set up on different blockchain platforms. Hence, this paper also proposes implementing Inter-Blockchain Protocol for the first time to include interoperability and communication between different platforms. Finally, the performance metrics that will be used to validate the BSMGs are outlined.}

abstract = {Blockchain technology has seen increasingly important practical applications. The literature has expanded greatly in the past four to five years. One area that has seen significant application and growth is in supply chain management—which includes transportation and logistics. The growth of this literature has also resulted in several literature reviews—each has specific scope and emphasis. Of the growing number of literature review and bibliometric analysis studies, the focus has ranged from understanding application cases, themes, trends, and methodologies. Theoretical developments and theorizing have been limited for supply chain management in general and even more limited for sustainable supply chains. Arguably, much of the current research has been relatively atheoretical—a lack of theory development and theory application. Hence, we conclude the existing blockchain research discourse has been centered around application and less around the theory. As a sub-discipline, the nexus of blockchain and supply chain management is still in the early developmental stages. Using a critical synthesis review of the literature, this paper focuses on the most popular theories that have been applied to explain blockchain adoption and implementation within supply chains—how each theory explains the motivations, formalizes the organizational process around the acceptance of blockchain technology, and predicts the outcomes of blockchain-supported business models. Current theoretical gaps and potential future theorizing are discussed. Potential theories that have been used for other technologies (i.e., the internet of things) which have not been applied to the blockchain context are provided and discussed. The comprehensive and systematic theory review has important theoretical and managerial implications for both academia by advancing multiple academic disciplines and practice with insights into actual acceptance and usage of blockchain and other disruptive technologies.}

Blockchains have the ability to maintain digital data, in its transparent form as well as unaltered one, with the help of distributed computing along with cryptography and hashing techniques. Such a blockchain technology, while incorporated with Supply Chain Management (SCM), is creating a huge impact on the economy. SCM is the technique to maintain the process transformation flow from the purchase of raw materials to the production of final products and plays a vital role in economy streamlining the business activities by aligning those with customer satisfaction while keeping an eye open to the competition. The significance of blockchain in the circular economy is more because it considers not only the business parameters but also the society and the environment too. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts are employed to ensure trustworthiness and reliability in the economy.

abstract = {The 4th industrial revolution (4IR) is in its early stage, and the exploitation of all its potential benefits is the challenge of the future. This revolution involves product information for consumers, which is relevant for addressing circular economy (CE) principles. The consumer is crucial for CE development, buying or not buying new, sustainable products designed according to CE principles and 4IR technologies. This is especially true for the new generations who will be the future consumers. We analyze the importance of younger generations in supporting these new products. In particular, the aim is to evaluate to what extent the market is able to sustain durability and repairability of CE characteristics of products included in the 4IR. Using a contingent valuation approach according to the theory of planned behavior, we investigate the willingness of university students to pay for smartphones produced with ecolabels that indicate such characteristics, attested by either paper-based scheme or blockchain technology. Results reveal that some variables, such as parental education, household income, and age, positively affect both participation and willingness to pay (WTP) the stated amount. Durability is always preferred to repairability, and paper-based scheme is preferred to blockchain technology. Interestingly, a good percentage of respondents are willing to support blockchain transition. Other results contribute to several strategic suggestions for developing sustainable products attaining CE and 4IR technologies.}

As years have gone by and with the continuous rise in population, both the natural resources and the biodiversity of this world are at the brink of exhaustion and collapse. Circular Economy (CE) is one such method that tackles both these problems at the same time. Worldwide energy production focuses on the shift from petroleum derivatives to biomass-based biofuels for the emerging sustainable bio-based economy. However, the concept of the biomass-based bio-refinery is in the early stages of development in many parts of the world. To confront global challenges environmentally and economically, the paradigm shift from biofuel production to bio-refinery is inevitable. This review summarizes various alternative feedstocks’ availability and their chemical potential for bio-refinery, application of recent developments like Big Data, blockchain technology and Internet of Things on bio-refinery framework. Furthermore, an emphasis has been made on the strategies and challenges in the production of the broad spectrum of platform chemicals and their incomparable global market value as it is an intermediate that bridges between the biomass and the value-added bio-based products. Thus, this review is an important key resource for researchers as it is a comprehensive analysis of the vital areas in bio-refinery.}

abstract = {Despite its clear potential to contribute to sustainability, there are many challenges to adopting circular economy (CE). These barriers impede the implementation of CE; however, research to address them is ongoing. For example, novel technologies have become a key enabler for easing the impact of CE adoption barriers. Blockchain is one disruptive technology that has the potential to address some of those barriers, notably technological, organizational, and ecological. Blockchain is particularly well suited to help address supply chain-oriented barriers to CE adoption. However, a review of the literature shows that while there are a limited number of conceptual studies that address the capabilities of blockchain to alleviate the impact of the barriers to CE, no previous study has focused on this vital subject using a decision tool based on expert data. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated decision framework involving Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-based Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method with Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) to investigate the true potential of blockchain to address the CE adoption barriers. Our findings indicate that enhanced supply chain traceability management, improved collaboration and coordination in supply chain ecosystems, building higher levels of trust in supply chain ecosystems, and enhanced business models are the most significant functions of blockchain to help overcome the CE adoption barriers.}

Fourth Generation Management arises as a systems-based approach for managing contemporary businesses before the advent of Industry 4.0 and during low awareness of the Circular Economy. While 4th Generation Management provides value to business by considering several resources, stakeholders, and interactions, making businesses customer-oriented, it fails to address the sustainability issue for contemporary businesses in the current context of Industry 4.0, Circular Economy, Competitiveness, and Stakeholders. Indeed, it fails to make businesses more contemporary (i.e., more open and sustainable) to adapt to their context. Moreover, in the literature, there is no work discussing how Sustainability, Industry 4.0, Circular Economy, Competitiveness, and diverse Stakeholders as contemporary issues are accounted for in business management. The main aim of this study is to propose a Re-engineered 4th Generation Management as a systems-based approach, enabling today's business to be oriented toward customer and sustainability. We have reviewed 181 articles published between 2005 and 2022 from Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases to pursue such a goal. The novelty of this work relies on presenting a systems-based approach, which is best suited for sustainable businesses in the context of Industry 4.0 digitalization technologies (e.g., Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, and Big data analytics), Circular Economy, Stakeholders, and Competitiveness.

The major proportion of C&D waste comprises of debris generated from the demolition activities, and their inadequate management can lead to disruption of natural resource cycles. Hence, there is a need to develop a holistic understanding of Demolition Waste Management (DWM) to reduce the building sector's impact on resources. Through a systematic literature review of 148 original journal articles, conference proceedings, and recent review papers (between the period 2000 to 2022) extracted from a scientific database, this study has identified 33 major global strategies for DWM guided by the Circular Economy (CE) framework through a perspective of the building lifecycle. A few of the strategies identified in this review are standardization of building components, incentivization of innovation, extended producer's responsibility, pre-demolition survey and audits, blockchain technology. Furthermore, the way ahead for the DWM in the Indian construction industry is assessed, and ten major challenges in CE implementation in India are discussed. The corrective actions are proposed against each challenge, and the extent of effort required for implementation with the impact created from each measure is also highlighted in this study. The review findings are valuable for both academicians and practitioners while establishing guidelines or framing policies during any stage of construction. The life cycle perspective of DWM proposed in this paper also attempts to chart a roadmap to reach various sustainable development goals.}

abstract = {Sustainability is high on the agendas of public and private organizations. Governments are setting targets for reducing the use of virgin raw materials in products and to eliminate waste. To accelerate the transition towards a Circular Economy (CE) policymakers are launching instruments. However, policy instruments, such as financial incentives or new regulatory guidelines, are prone to manipulations when the stakes for the involved stakeholders are high. Therefore, policymakers and government authorities need a solid system to monitor and control the implementation and effectiveness of their CE measures. To this end, digital technologies are key to enabling visibility and monitoring of materials flows. They allow governments and other stakeholders to use data to steer the transition towards a CE. However, data from different materials supply chains reside in a diversity of digital platforms used by a diversity of stakeholders involved. Blockchain-based platforms can support the required visibility by combining data from different stakeholders across different materials supply chains. But connecting all data for CE visibility throughout the entire materials flows into one singular platform is unlikely. With the growing number of blockchain-based platforms that each covers parts of data on CE flows, there is a need to assess the level of visibility they offer and to determine which data is lacking to monitor full CE flows. In this article, the development of a framework to evaluate blockchain-enabled information systems on their ability to act as monitoring systems for CE purposes is presented. The design science research approach was followed to develop the framework. Insights provided by academic literature as well as empirical data from three extant blockchain-enabled platforms were used (i.e., TradeLens, FoodTrust, and Vinturas). The evaluation framework can be deployed by public and private actors (e.g., governments and banks) for monitoring purposes, but also by IT providers to offer CE visibility solutions.}

Potential support for supply chain and sustainability issues include improving efficiency, transparency, and traceability in addition to billions of dollars in corporate financial savings. Given its promise, the adoption of blockchain technology, although hyped for years, has not seen rapid acceptance. In this study, the technology-organization-environment framework and force field theories are utilized to investigate blockchain adoption barriers. Using various literature streams on technology, organizational practices, and sustainability, a comprehensive overview of barriers for adopting blockchain technology to manage sustainable supply chains is provided. The barriers are explored using technology, organizational, and environmental – supply chain and external – framework followed by inputs from academics and industry experts and then analyzed using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) tool. The results show that supply chain and technological barriers are the most critical barriers among both academics and industry experts. We further determine the similarities and differences among academics and practitioners in perceiving the barriers. This exploratory study reveals interesting relative importance and interrelationships of barriers which are necessary, theoretically and practically for further adoption and dissemination of blockchain technology in a sustainable supply chain environment. It also sets the stage for theoretical observations for understanding blockchain technology implementation in sustainable supply chains.

Simultaneous competition and cooperation, or coopetition, is studied in strategy literature within the context of managing the complexity of business networks. Coopetition could offer valuable perspectives for firms transitioning to circular models. The purpose of this paper is to show how coopetition could be operationalized and optimized using tokens in a blockchain to support a transition to circular models of value creation and appropriation. The findings of our study indicate that tokens could enable previously disconnected product ecosystems to converge and unleash the waves of creativity and innovation required for circular business models. However, facilitating such convergence would require the coopetition models to transition from comprising the current stages of value creation and appropriation to being based on value creation and circulation.}

Although blockchain adoption is costly, it can raise customers’ green sensitivity level and exempt a firm from environmental taxes. A fair-minded retailer cares about disadvantageous inequity in addition to monetary payoffs. We compare the supply chain performance with and without blockchain, each in combination with and without emotional fairness concerns. We show that the manufacturer has the incentive to adopt blockchain if the operational cost is below a certain threshold, and this threshold increases in both tax rate and the blockchain-driven increment in customers’ green sensitivity. We find that fairness can encourage blockchain implementation if and only if the blockchain-driven increment in customers’ green sensitivity level is nominal. Moreover, blockchain adoption may weaken the positive impact of fairness on the supply chain performance such as the mitigation of double marginalization and consumer welfare improvement. We also find that blockchain can encourage green investment and benefit the retailer only if the blockchain-driven increment in customers’ green sensitivity level is relatively high; that is, an “all-win” situation for the supply chain can be achieved by blockchain adoption. Extended studies on consumption-based emission taxes and blockchain setup cost are also provided.}

We focus on a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer and an online platform. In the forward chain, the manufacturer sells products through the online platform who adopts reselling or agency selling sales format. In the backward chain, under extended producer responsibility, the manufacturer collects used products and can take advantage of the transparency, trust, and traceability features of blockchain technology, to increase the real recycling rate of used products and gain consumer trust. By constructing stylized differential game model, we clarify the condition of blockchain adoption and discuss the impact of blockchain on platform sales format selection and triple performance of the CLSC. The results show that the improvement in transparency and trust induced by blockchain will increase the brand goodwill and have positive effect on demand. Under blockchain-enabled recycling, the online platform and the manufacturer will reach a stable cooperation on platform reselling when the commission rate is extremely low, and agency selling when the commission rate is relatively high. However, the relationship of cooperation will break down when the commission rate is extremely high or relatively low. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the lower the real recycling rate, the better the effect of blockchain in enabling the triple sustainability of economy, environment, and society.}

abstract = {Blockchain technology has recently become the go-to solution for companies and industries that seek to enhance value chain traceability of their products, and transparency in their supply chains. Because of these benefits, it’s been proposed for monitoring environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and compliance in industries that have weak regulatory and formal structures. The cobalt mining industry especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world’s biggest producer of cobalt ore used in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, is one such environment that’s characterized by conflict, and serious human rights abuses. The key actors in the cobalt supply chain, therefore, face the tradeoff involving maintaining long-term supply versus reducing the risks associated with cobalt sourced from locations with poor environmental and human rights records. Most of such problems emerge from Artisanal and small-scale mining. This paper presents an attempt to tightly link existing blockchain technology frameworks in the cobalt industry with ESG performance of companies to enable them to audit the chain of custody journeys for their components and ultimately sustainability performance. We present a responsible sourcing framework to connect blockchain source data needs to ESG metrics to help companies build interoperable but understandable blockchain architectures.}

abstract = {Increasingly, the apparel industry generates enormous waste and pollution causing extreme water scarcity in emerging economies, where circular economy (CE) adoption can help to alleviate these pressing issues of this century. Environmentally conscious consumers gradually switch to purchasing secondhand clothes, prompting apparel companies to reposition their brands on sustainability dimensions. Nevertheless, buying secondhand apparel comes with a risk of counterfeiting and authenticity of the products. Blockchain can be an effective technology for tracking and tracing the products to their origin if effectively implemented in the apparel industry. In this study, we identify and analyze the antecedents to Blockchain-Enabled E-commerce Platform (BEEP) adoption in secondhand apparel retailing. We conducted a survey of Indian female consumers using the theoretical constructs of consumer’s buying motives and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results show that buying motives (namely economic motives, hedonic motives and critical motives) and UTAUT constructs (viz. performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and attitude) explain BEEP acceptance for secondhand apparel shopping. Risk of contamination increases BEEP adoption intention and also mediates the relationship between fashion motives and intention. Blockchain technology promotes behavioral intention towards online second-hand fashion clothing shopping, and by so doing reduces waste and promotes CE.}

While this might be partly caused by technology maturity problems, scholars also recognize a lack of vision about blockchain technology applications that might assist companies in implementing CE business models. Particularly, we miss knowledge about consumerdesired future CE scenarios to help the understanding of the likelihood of consumer adoption. In this paper, we therefore ask: What are, from the perspective of future consumers, desirable far-future CEs that use blockchain technology? We present the findings of a study that analyzed 57 consumer-desired CE scenarios in 2041 in which blockchain is used. From the analysis, we identify four ideal types of consumer-desired CEs, and the blockchain use cases in them. Based on that, we discuss and conclude on value propositions for CE business models that companies can use to attract consumer participation and blockchain adoption in pro-circular shifts. Second, we aimed at gathering consumer visions that can guide the strategic investment of companies in the development of blockchain technology applications for efficient CE business models.}

These impacts all can stand in the way of sustainable socioeconomic development and progress. Various multidimensional variables associated with the diseases and pathogens can be categorized in six subsystems: (i) ecological degradation, (ii) extreme weather events, (iii) supply chain management, (iv) food safety, (v) disaster management and (vi) public health policy. The variables related to these categories interact in a nonlinear way in complex adaptive systems. Various multidimensional variables, data management systems and advanced methods are required to model this complex issue. Hence, a model based on complex adaptive systems and blockchain technology-enabled agent-based modeling is proposed in this paper in order to assess the public health impact of foodborne zoonotic diseases and pathogens related to climate change. This model can be useful for identifying the risks and vulnerabilities related to the diseases and pathogens present in food systems.}

The scientific literature on the transition to sustainable food models continues to develop rapidly and there is an urgent need to systematize its knowledge structure and thus make future research more vigorous. Recently, several studies have focused on certain aspects of supply chain, such as traceability or decision-making frameworks, but a systematic review of the role of sustainability within the agrifood supply has never been carried out. Through a bibliometric analysis combined with network and content analyses, the present study is aimed at identifying homogeneous areas in the field of agrifood supply chains, investigating the role of innovation technology in the transition to sustainability. The bibliometric results showed that sustainable agrifood supply chains are experiencing an evolving positive trend and represent a challenging research topic which is capturing the attention of scholars. From the network and overlay visualization of keyword co-occurrences four different research clusters were identified and the blockchain emerged as central topic in the field of food security and safety. The content analysis highlighted greater attention to the environmental pillar, compared to the economic and social pillars of the sustainability paradigm. A lack of studies was also observed on the post-consumption phase of the agrifood supply chain, which could represent a research gap to be fulfilled in the light of circular economy.}

A novel design element, Margin Indicator (MI), is developed to obtain reliable predictive analytics results from the mainstream machine learning algorithms. The proposed approach supports a robust control of costs and energy, while maintaining a high level of transparency in managing decentralized AV supply chain processes, monetary impacts, and environmental sustainability. Testing the developed concept through a preliminary case study, we observed a reduction in energy wastage and hidden financial transactions by 12.48\% and 11.58\%, respectively.

To address this need, from the dynamic capability view, we identify value appropriation capability (VAC) as a vital catalyst translating BT into realizing green innovation in EBMs. Our results indicate that BT and VAC positively affect green innovation performance, while VAC also mediates the BT-green innovation relationship in EBMs. The main contribution is to offer new insight into the mechanisms between disruptive technology and the evolution towards EBMs through the lens of a previously under-researched dynamic capability, VAC. We also provide feasible, practical guidance for organizations to inspire green innovation and establish sustainable EBMs.}

The goal of this study, therefore, is three-fold: we first identify the challenges to blockchain using literature review and expert opinions. Then, we examine them using the proposed rough Interpretive Structural Modeling - Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication based on expert judgments. Finally, we link these challenges to diffusion of innovation theory. The results suggest that “lack of technical maturity” and “lack of interoperability” are the most important challenges of blockchain in the tourism industry.

However, the potential sustainability risks of introducing blockchain technology to SSCM, such as excessive energy consumption and additional operating training costs, are less considered. This paper aims to ascertain and evaluate the sustainability risk factors of applying blockchain technology to SSCM. Based on the triple bottom line, the risk factors are grouped into three categories, i.e., environmental risk factors, economic risk factors, and social risk factors. This paper proposes a comprehensive risk evaluation framework for adopting blockchain to SSCM considering severity (S), occurrence (O), detection (D), and response(R) of risk factors. Then, a new risk analysis method is developed. The proposed new approach integrates the strength of Best-Worst Method (BWM) in reducing the decision makers’ burden of pairwise comparisons of risk criteria importance, and the merit of rough Combined Compromise Solution method (CoCoSo) in flexibly handling incomplete and vague information without much priori information, which makes the results of risk analysis more accurate. The results demonstrate that increased training costs, and resource waste due to repeated audits and certifications are the two most prominent risk factors. These findings give practitioners managerial insights on blockchain technology application in SSCM.}

The increase in NFT transactions has drawn the attention of the art market to the consequent carbon emissions resulting from verifying transactions in proof-of-work blockchains supporting NFT transactions. With CO2-related deaths attributable to NFT transactions, social pressure from the art market has helped to progress the switch away from the deliberately polluting proof-of-work blockchains to more sustainable consensus protocols. Nonetheless, many popular types of blockchain have resisted the pressure to decrease their environmental impact, including Bitcoin, whose attributed 2021 annual emissions will produce emissions responsible for around 19,000 future deaths. In response, recent global policy interventions have employed legal and fiscal tools to reduce the carbon impact of some or all types of blockchains. Linking the damage caused by proof-of-work blockchains to climate change and human mortality, this study examines the recent policy interventions designed to motivate a shift in blockchain consensus protocols and promote miners' energy efficiency to mitigate environmental damage. This article further explores available policy intervention options that are currently not utilised.}

Blockchain generally refers to a secured, shared, distributed ledger comprising a list of transactions, which is not modifiable without reaching a consensus. Blockchain technology attempts to prepare the stage for smart networks for data mobility, which can remarkably make sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) more productive and transparent. Thus, numerous companies have either already started the implementation of this technology or are currently considering it in order to enhance their business quality. Therefore, in this paper, a new decision framework called the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS)-entropy-rank sum-weighting method (RSWM)-multi-objective optimization with ratio analysis with the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA) is developed. In this approach, the q-ROF-entropy-RSWM is utilized to obtain the subjective and objective weights of critical success factors, and the MULTIMOORA model is used to assess the preferences of manufacturing firms to implement blockchain technology in SSCM. An empirical case study is taken to evaluate the critical success factors of implementing blockchain technology in SSCM. Also, comparison and sensitivity investigation are made to show the superiority of the developed framework.}

CO2 levels are rising steadily, and while countries worldwide are actively moving toward the sustainability goals proposed during the Paris Agreement in 2015, we are still a long way to go from achieving a sustainable mode of global operation. The increased popularity of cryptocurrencies since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009 has been accompanied by an increasing trend in greenhouse gas emissions and high electrical energy consumption. Popular energy tracking studies (e.g., Digiconomist and the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (CBECI)) have estimated energy consumption ranges from 29.96 TWh to 135.12 TWh and 26.41 TWh to 176.98 TWh, respectively for Bitcoin as of July 2021, which are equivalent to the energy consumption of countries such as Sweden and Thailand. The latest estimate by Digiconomist on carbon footprints shows a 64.18 MtCO2 emission by Bitcoin as of July 2021, close to the emissions by Greece and Oman. This review compiles estimates made by various studies from 2018 to 2021. We compare the energy consumption and carbon footprints of these cryptocurrencies with countries around the world and centralized transaction methods such as Visa. We identify the problems associated with cryptocurrencies and propose solutions that can help reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprints. Finally, we present case studies on cryptocurrency networks, namely, Ethereum 2.0 and Pi Network, with a discussion on how they can solve some of the challenges we have identified.}

Within this perspective, a circular approach has been developed in the supply chain literature. Circular economy models and solutions assisted by industry 4.0 technologies have been developed to transform products in the end of their life cycle into new products with different use. In this paper an industry 4.0 waste-to-energy solution is developed and applied in a pilot case study comprised by a real-world supply chain to evaluate the sustainability performance of circular supply chain management (CSCM). The findings show that redesigning supply chains for circular economy with the use of Industry 4.0 technologies, can enable circular supply chain management. Clear benefits are provided linking the proposed solution to the six circular economy dimensions of the ReSOLVE model i.e. regenerate, share, optimise, loop, virtualise, and exchange. Improved availability of personnel (5\% and 15\%) and fleet resources (15\%) are identified as some of the key quantitative benefits, while supply chain traceability through the full visibility and automation offered by the proposed solution, are some of the key non-quantifiable outcomes. The present work seeks to contribute to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence of how industry 4.0 and circular economy are applied in practice. Implications for managers and policy makers, along with the study limitations and further research paths are also presented.}

Moreover, while new technologies, such as blockchain, might have important features that could impact circular economy frameworks, particularly in developing economies, their practical application remains to be seen, and academic literature is also scarce. This research addresses this gap and aims to provide conceptual clarity on how blockchains can be used in both circular and modified linear economy frameworks and the implications for social, environmental, and economic welfare. In order to do this, we have used two case studies from India to illustrate the application of this concept through a theoretical model based on Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom's seminal work regarding the eight design principles involving people's participation in protecting the commons. Merging the circular economy, blockchain, and Ostrom's seminal work, we advance a conceptual framework that allows us, from a holistic perspective, to create incentives and penalties for the different agents involved in the waste cycle, including the producers.}

abstract = {Nowadays, distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain technology) can play significant roles in improving supply chain management and sustainability. Blockchain technology can support responsible sourcing and ensure compliance with environmental standards by boosting traceability and transparency in sustainable supply chains. Nevertheless, blockchain technology has not been widely applied in this field due to the lack of familiarity of managers with its intrinsic characteristics. This study investigates the performance improvement, arising from the blockchain implementation, to address the problem of managerial conservatism and this technology adoption. Accordingly, an analytical approach is proposed to identify blockchain technology adoption enablers and analyze their impact on supply chain performance. At first, the main enablers, derived from the literature review, are explored using network theory. The existing causal relationships between enablers are extracted based on a multi-expertise team members’ agreement. Then, the fuzzy inference system is employed to determine the weights of relationships between the identified enablers and supply chain performance-related targets. After modeling the extracted causal relationships using the fuzzy cognitive map model, a scenario is defined for each enabler, and its impact on improving supply chain performance is estimated by implementing the hybrid learning algorithm. Finally, the obtained outputs are used to prioritize the blockchain technology adoption enablers using the fuzzy data envelopment analysis model. The result of this study implies that the blockchain technology can have a significant impact on mineral supply chain performance by creating smart contracts and enhancing environmental sustainability, traceability, and transparency.}

This study analyzes how China can employ blockchain technology to reform its energy sector. We survey the progress of blockchain technology in the energy sector and explore typical cases of energy blockchains in the world. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of applying blockchain to China's energy sector. China's monopoly market structure in energy supply impedes the application of blockchain technology, but the expansion of clean energy provides a huge opportunity for it. Although China's technological level is lagging, the biggest obstacle is not technology but rather policy. We conclude that China should loosen its regulatory environment, amend the relevant laws, and balance the conflict between management and innovation.}

Blockchain is designed to ensure the data is stored and updated in a secure, tamper-proof and irreversible way. Despite being in its nascent stages, the blockchain research is developing rapidly in different fields, making it imperative to capture the ethical and sustainability implications of blockchain development and implementation. The circular economy also focuses on enhancing sustainability and social responsibility, alongside economic growth. In this article, we critically review blockchain technology’s current and potential contribution to the circular economy through the lens of sustainability and social responsibility. This paper contributes to the Industry 4.0 literature by identifying, collating and organising the disparate research on blockchain, with a critical focus on its positive impact and potential repercussions for the ethics agenda. Within this narrative review, we argue and highlight the extant and potential alignment of blockchain with circular economy. Our findings show that blockchain technology can contribute to the circular economy by helping to reduce transaction costs, enhance performance and communication along the supply chain, ensure human rights protection, enhance healthcare patient confidentiality and welfare, and reduce carbon footprint. We also evaluate the challenges to blockchain implementation for circular economy, in terms of trust, illegal activities, potential for hacking and the need to address these through suitable legislation and policy development. Furthermore, we acknowledge the potential upfront costs involved in implementing blockchain technology, although we observe that the benefits are likely to exceed the challenges. We conclude this article with recommendations for future research in this field.}

Industry 4.0 has emerged in sustainable supply chain systems, blockchain is prominent, with the potential of immutable transparent data. Blockchains present potential to disrupt supply chains through digital transformation by enabling provenance, visibility, relationships, collaboration, lower costs, and enabling real-time trusted data. Scholars are increasingly investigating blockchain adoption, with an emphasis on technology acceptance modelling. Current research is valuable to understand potentials of blockchain technology in supply chains however, there is limited work on the building blocks for blockchain adoption in digital transformation of supply chains. This study aims to investigate through a systematic literature review and case studies, the building blocks for blockchain adoption in digital transformation of sustainable supply chains. Blockchain adoption in supply chain management is receiving increasing attention, along with highlights of critical factors. This paper offers a building block model that is in three main phases; pre-adoption, adoption, and the post adoption. The model indicates that adoption context, blockchain technology platform offerings, strategic responses, and adoption readiness are some key building blocks, particularly at the pre-adoption phase. Trust and supply chain network, firm resources, and blockchain costs are all considered critical in the considerations of the building blocks. In addition, aligning supply chain objectives with blockchain systems is critical and so is blockchain compatibility. Law and governance are amongst the two prominent challenges in blockchain adoption and should be considered as part of the building blocks for blockchain adoption.}

abstract = {The world is heading in the wrong direction on carbon emissions where we are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 °C; Ireland is among the countries where overall emissions have continued to rise. The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed ‘Paludiculture’) present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing ‘green’ eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from ‘brown to green’ must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the ‘Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution’. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation.}

For example, blockchain can assist in developing innovative business models throughout the solar photovoltaic energy ecosystem (SPVEE) to improve CE. Ranked fifth in total installed photovoltaic (PV) capacity, Turkey, as a developing country, should take the necessary steps and make progress towards achieving CE in the SPVEE. The solar PV industry requires further innovation to address the negative environmental impact of existing linear business models. To ensure favorable results, identifying and evaluating critical success factors (CSFs) are necessary. However, no study has investigated CSFs for SPVEE or any other renewable energy source to achieve a blockchain-based infrastructure towards increased CE performance. Therefore, the goal of this study is to identify and examine the CSFs to improve the performance of a blockchain-based SPVEE towards CE in Turkey. To this end, first, the CSFs for blockchain-based SPVEE were identified through both a literature review and the Nominal Group Technique (NGT). Then, Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IF)-DEMATEL was used to explore their interrelationships based on the expert data. Finally, IF-DELPHI was employed to validate the results. Our findings suggested that effective government incentive programs and regulations are significant for blockchain-based SPVEE towards CE in Turkey. The findings of this study assist macro and micro decision-making in the potential implementation of blockchain in Turkish SPVEE to improve CE. They are also invaluable for other countries and can be used as a reference point.}

One of the leading causes of climate change is the emissions of harmful gases, particularly CO2. In 1997, the Kyoto protocol was signed by 192 countries, creating a system that monetizes CO2 emissions with an aim to control them. Most countries signed a carbon trading scheme, but the scheme fell short of its goals due to manipulation, lack of integrity, and multiple other challenges. This work presents an improved blockchain-based approach to achieve the objective of monitoring the reduction of carbon emissions. Blockchain's distinct features such as security, immutability, transparency, traceability, and trust, make it a robust and reliable solution for the carbon trading market. Previous Blockchain-based proposals were not comprehensive, practical, applicable, or efficient enough to form an effective solution. This research addresses the current gaps and proposes a comprehensive three-stage hierarchical blockchain framework that employs smart contracts in Blockchain of Things (BoT) to ensure integrity in the system and reach fair trade status that favors the environment over companies' cost reductions and profit-making. The result is an optimized carbon emission trading framework, fully transparent with automated trading and control mechanisms.}

abstract = {Our planet is currently facing unprecedented interconnected environmental, societal, and economic dilemmas due to climate change, the outbreak of pandemics and wars, among others. These global challenges pose direct threats to food security and safety and clearly show the urgent need for innovative scientific solutions and technological approaches. Backed by the current alarming situation, many food-related trends have emerged in recent years in response to these global issues. This review looks at two megatrends in agriculture and the food industry; the shift to vegetable diets and the digital transformation in food production and consumption patterns. On one side, several innovative technologies and protein sources have been associated with more sustainable food systems and enhanced nutritional quality and safety. On the other side, many digital advanced technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and 3D printing) have been increasingly applied in smart farms and smart food factories to improve food system outcomes. Increasing adoption of vegetal innovations and harnessing Industry 4.0 technologies along the food supply chain have the potential to enable efficient digital and ecological transitions.}

abstract = {A transition towards a circular economy within the agri-food sector requires the improvement of efficiency in resource utilization, the prevention of food loss or waste, whilst adopting regenerative agricultural practices. In addition to the technical challenges, the agri-food industry needs to address the food safety concerns resulting from biomass recycling processes. Increasingly, blockchain technology is gaining traction, moving towards more sustainable and precision agriculture. The blockchain is a decentralized, immutable, and shared database that records the provenance of digital assets, making it a suitable platform for traceability and food supply chain management. Despite its growing importance, the existing literature regarding these themes and the empirical evidence of blockchain-based solutions for a circular economy is rather fragmented. This paper offers a scoping review regarding the role of blockchain technology in the transition towards a circular food system. A total of 44 papers published in peer-reviewed journals were reviewed to identify new scientific insights into the application of blockchains within the agricultural sector. The results indicate that blockchain technology has a great potential in reducing food loss through optimized eco-efficiency (e.g., digitalization and integration with the Internet of Things) and by alleviating asymmetric information (by increasing transparency and reducing dependence on intermediaries). However, in the case of recycling efficiency, despite its potential, there remains a paucity of evidence regarding the use of blockchain technology in improving the residual valorization processes. Furthermore, there is a stream of literature focusing on the ability of blockchain-enabled traceability (e.g., for organic production or supply chain management). Yet, the role of blockchain traceability in the monitoring of risks from recycled biomass and the reporting of the sustainability performance in the supply chain has received scant attention within research literature. These results provide insights for supply chain management operations with the view of shifting towards a circular economy whilst also suggesting an agenda for future research areas.}

Food industry players have also become increasingly involved in these issues due to stakeholder pressures, and this highlights the importance in understanding what sustainability practices and best practices are being utilised. This review identifies the current state of knowledge of how food manufacturing companies implement sustainability in their operations and across their supply chains. A thematic analysis was conducted on 130 papers that were published over a 21-year time frame from 1999 to 2020 to identify eight key sustainability themes in the literature. These themes included – life cycle assessments, drivers, barriers and incentives to sustainability, waste and recycling management, food chain logistics, sustainability practices in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), supplier management, partnerships and relationships and “other” sustainable supply chain management practices. Through examining the extant literature, it is clear that there remains substantial scope for research on the role of SMEs and food logistics, as there is scant research on both areas despite their critical role within sustainable supply chain management. It is also clear that large multinational companies have a critical role in supporting supply chain practices through not only driving practices but also in providing critical resources and collaboration for partners across the supply chain. Circular economy is emerging as a key research area that is experiencing increasing focus in recent years, although it is argued that future research should focus on digitisation efforts such as through Internet of Things and blockchain that has been highlighted as a major disruptive and supportive element in increasing sustainability across supply chains.}

This research aims to explore the feasibility of applying blockchain technology (BCT) in marine plastic debris management. A case study on three pioneer recycling organizations is conducted based on secondary data. The study found that BCT can be applied to solve some of the existing challenges of marine plastic debris management. A digital token system and identity recognition mechanism based on BCT can increase the public awareness for marine plastic debris governance. The derived digital wallets and distributed ledgers can effectively replace paper documents and cash transactions in the traditional recycling chain, and minimize global impact on local economies, thus improve efficiency and safety. Also, the traceability and high transparency of blockchain and the application of smart contracts can effectively build a global recycling network. In addition, the application of BCT can greatly improve the transparency of recycling value chains, and make them more accepting of supervision from society and consumers. This research is one of the first studies on BCT in marine plastic debris management and explores worldwide pioneering companies. In practice, this study can help companies analyse the defects in their own waste disposal models and help practitioners make decisions to adopt BCT. In academia, as one of the early exploratory studies on the application of BCT to the treatment of marine plastic debris, this study provides further empirical reference on BCT based business models and recycling chains, and can guide future research in this field.}

This integration requires breaking the ”silos” of the circular chain to establish new collaborative and sustainable value networks. The paper introduces a novel digital platform for the CE, which is currently under development in the H2020 DigiPrime project. The platform is destined to facilitate seamless and trusted information exchange across circular actors, while offering a range of value-added services that enable manufacturers, remanufactures, recyclers and other actors to gain insights in the status of recycling and waste management processes. The latter facilitates the implementation of zero waste processes, along with the assessment of the performance of the circular chain. The paper introduces the architecture of the digital platform, along with its data modelling, exchange and data traceability mechanisms. It also presents a CE use case used to validate the platform.}

The purpose of this review is to assess the potential role of blockchain technology in enhancing the governance of sociotechnical energy transitions. For this, the paper reviews: (1) the governance arrangements shaping distributed energy transitions, (2) the emergence of blockchain-based solutions in the energy sector (focusing on P2P energy trading platforms) and, (3) the role of the blockchain in overcoming the governance limitations of distributed energy transitions. The study addresses emerging but interrelated niches of academic study from an integral conceptualization and synthesis of the literature. Rather than extensively covering these fields of research, the purpose is to connect these areas of academic knowledge and expand the theoretical understanding stemming from this convergence.

An original framework is developed to categorise Circular Economy enablers, levers and potential benefits. Companies in the EEE industry aiming to implement Circular Economy can exploit several enablers (grouped into digitalization, government intervention, and users’ active role) and levers (grouped into circular product design, servitised business models, and supply chain management) to generate economic, environmental and social benefits. Based on the framework, 115 articles were scrutinised. The analysis led to the definition of a research agenda, with policy and industry implications. To advance Circular Economy research in the EEE supply chain, future studies should address: (i) the enabling role of digitalization, particularly within blockchain, 3D Printing, augmented and virtual reality; (ii) design strategies focused on ‘reduce’; (iii) servitised business models based on result-oriented offerings; (iv) collaboration in the EEE supply chain; (v) the assessment of social and economic benefits to users.

Logistics application, such as the southern banana transportation to the country, major cities can buy all the year round; Xinjiang ha honey melon, Ningxia white orchid melon, northeast rice, Tianjin small station rice are not seasonal supply market. However, with the increasing frequency of logistics activities, its damage to natural resources and ecological environment is becoming more and more serious. The waste produced in logistics is increasing day by day, which puts great pressure on the environment. Such as steel slag, industrial waste water, waste computers, waste batteries and other kinds of inorganic waste. Goods return is the most important activity in the green reverse logistics. Because reverse logistics is a kind of logistics activity including product return, logistics replacement, item reuse, waste disposal, reprocessing, repair and remanufacturing and other processes. Returns are the key part of it. In order to ensure the goods, return to the manufacturer and get good disposal, it is necessary to record the whole process information of the goods from the factory to the customer. Blockchain is a chain composed of one block after another. Each block holds certain information in each block, which are connected into chains in their respective chronological order. Based on this, this paper proposes a sustainable development strategy of green reverse logistics based on blockchain. In the strategy research, based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering and high information security of blockchain technology(BT), this paper proposes a commodity traceability scheme based on blockchain. In this traceability scheme, this paper uses the structure of Merkel tree to design a license chain to store detailed commodity traceability information, and stores the Merkel tree root node of the license chain block in the public chain, forming a “double chain” structure of commodity traceability system. The simulation analysis shows that the traceability information stored in the license chain can use the high security of the public chain to ensure the security of information. Compared with the traditional blockchain, the double chain structure designed in the article, has a larger throughput, which can trace the source of the product to the manufacturer, ensure that the goods can be returned to the manufacturer for further processing, reduce the generation of waste in the logistics, and provide a guarantee for promoting the sustainable development of green reverse logistics.}

This study integrates the normal and virtual supply chains into a single framework. To maximise the total expected revenue (TER) from the VCLSC, the costs of getting raw materials and parts, transporting them with a carbon emission tax, handling, processing, and making final products, refurbishing, recycling, and virtualization are all taken into account. These include running blockchain and IoT facilities, buying RFID tags, ensuring security, and storing data in blockchain in a way that cannot be changed. The above costs are captured in a single mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. The main objective is to maximise the TER by minimising the cost of the VCLSC network. For the solution purposes, the global solver in LINGO 19 software package is used. The obtained results and performed sensitivity analysis are used to make some implications for business organisations and government administrators to create some important policies in favour of the environment, end-users, and the development of the organisation along with the nation.}

This paper surveys how blockchain can overcome potential barriers to achieving sustainability from two perspectives, namely, the manufacturing system perspective and the product lifecycle management perspective. The survey first examines literature on these two perspectives, following which the state of research in blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing is presented, which sheds new light on urgent issues as part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We found that blockchain-empowered transformation of a sustainable manufacturing paradigm is still in an early stage of the hype phase, proceeding toward full adoption. The survey ends with a discussion of challenges regarding techniques, social barriers, standards, and regulations with respect to blockchain-empowered manufacturing applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and social barriers that blockchain technology must overcome to demonstrate its sustainability in industrial and business spheres.}

abstract = {In practice, agricultural products' bacteria pollution is frequently reported, how to allocate the pollution cost among the supply chain parties can be challenging yet because bacteria pollution occurs randomly, and the evidence is usually absent. We build a game-theoretic model comprising of two competing suppliers and a powerful retailer. We characterize blockchain's value in identifying the responsible party for bacteria pollution and the supply chain parties' participation incentives. We identify the conditions under which incentive alignment of the supply chain parties to participate in blockchain can be achieved. We find that the powerful retailer and the supplier selling high-quality products are better off in blockchain. However, the supplier selling low-quality products will be better off only when (a) the powerful retailer's brand image improvement is sufficiently significant, or, (b) the powerful retailer's brand image improvement is moderate but supply uncertainty is very significant. We further find that blockchain improves the supply chain's economic sustainability, whereas environmental sustainability is improved when (a) the powerful retailer's brand image improvement is small or (b) the powerful retailer's brand image improvement is moderate but the supply uncertainty is small.}

Through explorative design science and systematic combining, the deployment of a permissionless blockchain system for collecting product life-cycle data is conceptualized, demonstrated, and evaluated by experts. The purpose of the blockchain-based solution is to manage product data interactions, to maintain an accurate single state of product information, and to provide an economic incentive structure for the provision and the deployment of the solution. The evaluation by knowledgeable researchers and practitioners identifies the aspects limiting blockchain-based deployment of solutions in the current industrial landscape. Combining theory and practice, the paper lays the foundation for a blockchain-based approach to product information management, placing design priority on inter-industrial and self-sustained deployment.}

Ill-sourced minerals not only finance terrorism, human trafficking, and other major issues in society, but they deter deliberately conscientious organizations from their goals of achieving genuinely sustainable products that are considerate towards the environment and society. This paper aims to understand the problem of responsible sourcing from the point of view of the mining and the metallurgical industry. The study helps identify areas of improvement for this global industry to minimize conflict originating from natural resource development and achieve the noble goal of being certified as Conflict Free. Further, existing paths to accreditation are classified into three categories: Certification Approaches, Analytical Approaches, and Inscription Approaches. A comparison of the approaches is given on parameters like accuracy, cost of implementation, and difficulty of implementation. The study finds that although Analytical Approaches appear to be the most feasible among all the other approaches, their extremely high cost of implementation has prevented their wide adoption, thus perpetuating the difficulty of systematically managing the problem of conflict minerals at scale. Finally, the use of Blockchain Technology (BCT) to overcome the limitations of current mineral traceability schemes is given. Due to limited academic research on this topic, the focus was diverted to how other industries have utilized BCT and proposed the next steps for mineral researchers.}

Continuously increasing amounts of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) is a critical problem globally. As a quantitative modeling approach to solve complex problems, system dynamics (SD) is frequently adopted to help understand the dynamic interrelationship of contributing variables of C&DW management and predict future behavior for both short and long-term decision making. However, there has been no systematic review of such SD applications to C&DW management. The aim of this study is therefore to provide a systematic review of current applications of SD modeling to C&DW management in order to identify research gaps and provide future related research opportunities. The novelty of this paper is that it is the first time that bibliometric visual analysis has been adopted to interpret visualized network maps of the co-occurrence of countries, keywords, and citations of selected articles on the application of SD modeling in C&DW management. The SD modeling applications of these articles are comprehensively reviewed from the two main C&D waste management perspective of the 3R principle and sustainability. The results reveal that more research effort has been made to reduce and recycle C&DW than to reuse it, and that the economic and environmental performance of C&DW attracts more attention than its social performance. The study suggests that to deepen and broaden the analysis of C&DW management, future research could use hybrid models by combining SD with emerging techniques and tools, such as building information modeling, geographic information systems, and blockchain technology.}

Effective healthcare systems should be capable of sustainably delivering high quality and accessible patient care services using data shared through the best available technologies. However, healthcare data are generally hard to comprehend, use, and share since they are also inaccessible, non-standardized, and disseminated throughout the network. Blockchain may be employed to alleviate the impact of these challenges. However, only a few blockchain platforms (BP) have reached the stable design and established user base needed to give a healthcare organization (HO) confidence in their implementation. Each digital transformation project employing blockchain faces the challenge of picking a BP suitable to the requirements of a HO. While some research has been conducted to choose an appropriate BP, quantitative studies on specific industries, including healthcare, are currently insufficient. This investigation provides a case addressing the selection of the most feasible BP for a healthcare group. To this end, we propose a new multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework that integrates the extent analysis-based rough Analytic Hierarchy Process (RAHP-E) and rough Compromise Programming (RCP). The findings of this study are validated through several analyses.}

In the proposed system, the dynamic demand based pricing policy for the vehicle owners is proposed using types of vehicles, time of demand and geographical locations. The vehicles’ social welfare and utility are maximized using an optimal scheduling method along with the proposed pricing policy. Also, the vehicle owners’ privacy is protected by applying differential privacy in the proposed consensus energy management algorithm. The numerical analyses show that 89.23\% reduction in energy price is achieved as compared to 83.46\%, 73.86\% and 53.07\% for multi-parameter pricing scheme (MPPS), fixed pricing scheme and time-of-use pricing scheme (ToU), respectively. Applying the proposed scheme, the owners can achieve about 81.46\% reduction in their operating cost as compared to 80.48\%, 69.75\% and 68.29\% for MPPS, fixed pricing scheme and ToU, respectively. Moreover, the proposed system is 60.32\% secure as compared to 39.67\% for MPPS system. Furthermore, using less information loss against considerable background knowledge of an attacker, higher privacy protection of vehicles is attained.}

In this review, a general overview of green and Industry 4.0 technologies from a food perspective will be provided. Connections between green food technologies (e.g., green preservation, processing, extraction, and analysis) and Industry 4.0 enablers (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet of Things) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be identified and explained. Green and Industry 4.0 technologies are both rapidly becoming a valuable part of meeting the SDGs. These technologies demonstrate high potential to foster ecological and digital transitions of food systems, delivering societal, economic, and environmental outcomes. A range of green technologies has already provided innovative solutions for major food system transformations, while the application of digital technologies and other Industry 4.0 technological innovations is still limited in the food sector. It is therefore expected that more green and digital solutions will be adopted in the coming years, harnessing their full potential to achieve a healthier, smarter, more sustainable and more resilient food future.}

However, for some reasons, blockchain has not been widely used in food safety management. So further study on the advantages and challenges of its application is beneficial to the sustainable development of food enterprises, consumers and the government. Its application can provide traceable information for food companies, consumers and governments. This can not only ensure the food safety of enterprises, but also improve the level of government supervision, so as to establish the trust between consumers, enterprises and the government, which improves the efficiency and level of food safety management. Based on the information adoption model, this study takes 202 text data related to blockchain and food safety on the Zhihu platform as the research object.

Listed companies assume the responsibility to submit annual reports to disclose their ESG outcomes genuinely. However, the challenge is that companies may overstate or slur their actual sustainable performance, and the entire ESG reporting process is hidden backward, thereby making the report untrustworthy. Accordingly, this paper proposes an architecture of smart ESG reporting platform leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies to enable corporate crowdsensing for environmental data and enhance the security, transparency and creditability of ESG reporting process. In addition, with the aim of motivating firms to upload massive ESG raw data of high quality, we devise an incentive mechanism that grants them crypto tokens as a reputation for sustainable performance disclosure, exposed to industry and investors for reference. The maximum tokens settlement for each environmental key performance indicator (KPI) is regarded as a cooperative game for premiums, and Shapley value is applied to fairly distribute the tokens in line with the disclosure significance scored by experienced investors. Here, we take the ESG reporting guide issued by the Hong Kong exchange (HKEX) and the practice in the Hong Kong apparel industry as the context. An experimental simulation is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed platform architecture and approach of token allocation. This study holds the promise of providing a precedent for adopting the advanced technologies to address the greenwashing in firms and actualize intelligent and trustable ESG reporting.}

New Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are changing the way in which the world works. These technologies provide new tools to face the issues of contemporary society (poverty, migrations, sustainable development challenges, governance, etc.). Among them, blockchain emerge as a disruptive technology able to make things in a completely different and innovative way. They can provide solutions where before there were none. Recently, these technologies have become subject of intense research and development by industry and academia. In consequence, a large amount of interesting works is published in many areas, proposing solutions, services, frameworks and applications based on these technologies. The research focusing on the previous challenges are especially interesting in current society. However, the proposals arrive at higher speed than society can assimilate them, and sometimes they are not properly exploited. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the blockchain technology to identify what are its key attributes that enable to successfully address the social challenges. The review has been conducted from three point of views: service-delivery, resource-management and city-administration, and has been focused on the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, in order to cover the full agenda of current social issues. The contributions of this work are an exhaustive compilation of the existing research on blockchain technology to tackle the social challenges from several angles, and the identification of the key features and the conditioning factors of the practical applicability of the technology.}

The thesis of this research is that smart city agendas have failed in their promise of being citizen-centric instruments and this is due to their top-down approach. This can be reversed by using community-led technologies such as blockchain. However, this bottom-up and blockchain-based implementation of smart city agendas will require from new, people-centric measurement tools and thus the so-called Activators and Aggregators are designed as well.}

However, this seemingly attractive SLB market development is far behind the rapidly accumulated retired batteries due to the lack of accurate pricing information, successful business models, data transparency, and unclear government policies. To mitigate these challenges, we first construct a pricing model to enable the prediction of SLB prices. Our results anticipate roughly 403 GWh, 379 GWh, and 195 GWh of retired batteries for second-life usage in China, Europe, and the United States, with the SLB price below 50 \$/kWh in these countries/regions under the base scenario in 2030. Second, we develop a sustainable framework for the SLB ecosystem based on blockchain, which has a physical layer covering all the stakeholders along its value chain and a digital layer backed up by blockchain to record and store all relevant data generated through the process. The knowledge of the predicted SLB prices can facilitate the investors and consumers, who are the core components of the SLB ecosystem’s physical layer, in the decision-making process of investing and implementing SLBs. In return, the market information provided by such a digital layer plays an essential role in SLB pricing. Finally, a sustainability impact analysis is undertaken to validate the framework’s competitiveness in surviving a sustainable future. Our framework’s convergence of digitalization and sustainability enables the SLB industry to create long-lasting positive impacts.}

Although the operational risk of blockchain-integrated systems (BISs) is significant, studies in this area are still conceptual and scarce. This research is a mixed-methods risk analysis focusing on (1) modeling the risk situation by a connected network of potential disruptive events in container shipping BISs, and (2) applying a quantitative risk analysis with probabilistic indexes considering the multiplicity of multi-event risk scenarios (MESs). Thirty-two telephone interviews with experts from container terminal operators, shipping companies, and freight forwarders helped establish a risk network with the description of 25 vertices and 54 directed connections. The quantitative analysis of 64 web survey responses provided insights and foresight about different characteristics of each risk and causal connection. The results enable a comprehensive view of the potential failure modes of blockchain applications. This study is the first to explore the potential risk situation in container shipping BISs with inputs from the industry. The applied methodological framework expands the toolkit of risk researchers, analysts, and managers against the fast-paced development of digitalization in maritime logistics and supply chain operations.}

The present study aims to investigate the convenience analysis of sustainable electronic agriculture based on blockchain technology, and analyze the application prospect and challenges of blockchain in the agricultural field. In this experiment, five villages with similar development rates in China were selected as the objects.Firstly, blockchain technology was applied to sustainable e-agriculture by using data statistics to explore its convenience. Furthermore, the big data analysis method is used to fit and analyze the data to see which groups of people in each age group are the real benefits of blockchain technology. Using the single variable method to compare the convenience of traditional e-agriculture and sustainable e-agriculture based on block chain. Variance analysis and comparison of data were performed using SPSS19.0 analysis software one-way ANOVA program. Data results were expressed in the form of mean value. According to the experimental data, the e-commerce applications of fresh commodities, whole grains and aquatic products have reached a high degree of convenience, while the convenience of valuable commodities and fragile commodities is lower. However, compared with the traditional e-agriculture, the convenience has increased by more than 15\%. In the middle and young age, blockchain projects all get outstanding convenient data; only in the middle and old age, the data is lower. Experimental data show that sustainable electronic agriculture based on blockchain technology brings great convenience to farmers’ sales, increasing by 25\% on average compared with traditional electronic agriculture, which will bring vigorous vitality to the sustainable development of agricultural products.}

The integration of blockchain technology in farming is gaining attention for its potential to migrate from the centralized and monopolistic model that shapes today’s food value chain. This paper highlights the fact that most of today’s blockchain-based farming frameworks focus on food tracking and traceability. Only rarely does research focus on the design of digital marketplaces to support the trading of agricultural goods between farmers and potentially interested third party stakeholders; equally rarely are performance evaluations performed for the proposed frameworks. The latter is where this paper contributes the most by, not only proposing a novel blockchain-based farming marketplace platform (called “FarMarketplace”), but also a comprehensive methodology to help software solution integrators to better understand and measure how a given configuration setting of such a platform can influence the overall quality of service performance in the long run.}

However, the domain's sensitive nature and complexity require blockchain-enabled e-healthcare to ensure utilitarianism while suitably addressing the associated ethical challenges. In this milieu, the paper attempts to identify and evaluate the parameters of ethical challenges associated with blockchain adoption in e-healthcare. This paper contributes to the extant body of knowledge by presenting a critical review of the ethical considerations at the meso level of blockchains in e-healthcare. Based on findings from the literature, the study identified nine parameters of blockchain ethics. Of these, Accuracy and Right to be Forgotten were found to be most critical in terms of ethical dilemmas in healthcare applications. No evidence of ethical dilemma could be found with respect to Accountability and Data Ownership. As these services are deployed over networks, all these challenges are further evaluated in the context of 6G network-based models. This will not only provide the stakeholders with a holistic view of the ethical challenges in various blockchain-enabled healthcare applications but also enable a meticulous transition to the 6G network.}

Effective blockchain adoption (BCA) and better supply chain visibility (SCV) via organizational and production knowledge management (KM) have emerged as the most powerful instruments for improving sustainable organizational performance (SOP). Therefore, drawing on the resource-based view and technology acceptance model, this study seeks to underline the empirical relationships among KM, BCA, SCV, and SOP in a developing country context of Chinese manufacturing, as research in this sector is still nascent encompassing these constructs. Data were collected from 289 respondents (senior, middle, and junior) level staff members from manufacturing industries and analyzed by a novel approach; partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The empirical analyses indicated that KM significantly impacts BCA. BCA also positively affects SCV. Besides BCA, the KM also positively impacts SOP. The mediation effect analysis revealed the significant serial mediating impact of BCA and SCV on the relationship of KM to SOP. This study enriches the inadequate literature and throws light on BCA from an organizational resource perspective. The study deepens our understanding and delivers valued insights to the managers and policymakers of manufacturing industries concerning the role of KM, BCA, and SCV in achieving SOP.}

However, current approaches cannot efficiently reduce road travel, making it challenging to decarbonize in the transport sector. Therefore, in this paper, we propose STRICTs, a blockchain-enabled motor vehicle restrictive and trading system based on the carbon emissions cap. STRICTs allows automated carbon emission auditing and carbon emission violation punishment without relying on third-party escrow. Through a decentralized enforcer, STRICTs also enables carbon permit trading reliably and transparently. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the system based on Hyperledger Fabric and conduct experiments for comprehensive performance evaluation through CO2 Emission by Vehicles dataset. The experiment results show the practically affordable performance of STRICTs.}

Although Blockchain has become known for its support of crypto-coins (or crypto currencies), especially Bitcoin, its scope has become much larger, including businesses of relevant social impact. This paper presents an application of the Ethereum’s Blockchain digital architecture for the solid waste management in a small municipality in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. This application comes to replace a paper-based current system. The current system uses printed cards called Green Coins, presenting vulnerabilities that should be overcome with the implementation of the new system. The blockchain-based system provides financial management for the collection of waste in the municipality aiming at better health and socio-environmental education and the financial and social inclusion of volunteer citizens, through the use of social currency. The proposed application uses social crypto-coins and security support through Ethereum’s Blockchain, instead of the printed cards currently being used, including volunteer citizens, store owners and public agents. It should contribute in a relevant way to improving the quality of life in the municipality in relation to the typical aspects of sustainability: education, health, environment, social inclusion and local economy, contributing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The proposed application may eventually expand in to other municipalities, including major urban centers and private condominiums.}

For two decades, the construction industry has attempted to mitigate its environmental impact by adopting green building strategies. However, due to a lack of a secure and accurate measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system, lowering the industry's carbon footprint has not been embraced by building owners. The building industry has not been able to participate in the carbon credit markets as well. Several factors are contributing to this failure. The primary issue is the complicated and insecure accounting system for accurately tracking energy consumption and carbon emissions. Although there are several building energy performance (BEP) audit schemes, these programs do not provide a suitable structure for a secure and accurate carbon emission MRV. Some climate action groups have navigated an overview of Blockchain for climate actions, especially in registries and tracking solutions, digital MRV, decentralized environment of clean energies, and climate finance. Moreover, there are several attempts to adopt blockchain MRV systems in the climate action projects, and blockchain carbon credit markets were already in place since Blockchain technology can offer a transparent, reliable, and affordable MRV system. This research walked through the literature of the BEP audit programs, the carbon credit market for the building sector, the possibility of adopting Blockchain technology to a digital BEP MRV. The study found that the digital MRV system, which climate action projects require, can be applied to the building sector with the adoption of Blockchain technology. Next, because a few blockchain carbon credit markets are already running, a blockchain digital MRV system needs to be developed to help the building sector participate in the carbon credit markets.}

The needy segments of the population must be provided with financial services to accomplish this inclusion. Still, the traditional financial market is unavailable due to its lack of collateral and shallow income. Thus, they go to local moneylenders, also known as "loan sharks," who charge exorbitant interest rates. Introduction to microfinance came as a new and refreshing light to these needy segments of the population as it provides small valued loans (micro-credit) to support their micro-scale businesses and engage in productive activities. As emerging technology started to be incorporated into every aspect of society, thus microfinance also needed to be incorporated into the technology. An application is required to protect data integrity and smoothly influence the microfinance sector. As the databases are vulnerable to data manipulation, this can affect the transaction history of the loan. Blockchain technology can be used to solve this problem, as data in the Blockchain is stored immutably. So, we designed a microfinance application that uses blockchain technology with decentralised KYC architecture to reduce multiple KYC verification and easy access to micro-credit.}

Our research identifies (i) lack of channels for transparent and equitable sharing of know-how and materials (ii) lack of incentives, (iii) lack of trust among stakeholders, and (iv) lack of traceability options as main hindering reasons for in situ CRI with agrobiodiversity. Further, we find that blockchain solutions may empower data providers, including small farmers, to collectively track, control and monetize the use of data and assets shared while minimizing fraudulent activities. Transaction costs may also be lowered by removing complex and expensive interaction processes. However, further research and development are necessary to design an ethical and sustainable blockchain-based solution to incentivize in situ conservation, research and innovation with agrobiodiversity. Some future directions of research are recommended.}

abstract = {Energy has always been one of the fundamental elements in the growth of human society. It is crucial that we improve our energy management due to the ever-growing imbalance in demand-supply. The new wave in the energy sector is characterized by the three D's of decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization. For a sustainable life, it is necessary that energy is tapped from alternative sources that are renewable to leave a minimal carbon footprint. To integrate different sources with the main power grid, we require two-way communication among them. This makes it indispensable that consumers are empowered to protect their privacy and make them the sole owners of their data. A good access control scheme would ensure security of data, and an efficient trading platform would ensure judicious use of the resources. Here, we propose a framework URJA with an access control scheme and an energy trading platform based on blockchain for a smart grid. The locally available renewable sources of energy are connected to the grid such that demand-supply is managed effectively without loss of efficiency and privacy. A customized consensus scheme based on trust ensures a quick operation in real-time.}

abstract = {Although blockchains are systems that are intended to survive on their own, they still may need human intervention like other Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) architectures. The reasons for this intervention are twofold: management of blockchain nodes and governance of blockchain. The second focuses on sustaining blockchain unlike the first one concerning with operation of individual nodes. Proposed blockchain governance models so far include cumbersome processes in which deciding and deployment of changes rely on the involvement of multiple actors. They have been criticized from various aspects such as reducing the decentralized nature of blockchain. In this paper, we propose a novel on-chain governance model exploiting both policy-based management and decentralized identity technologies. Since it allows controlling the behavior of the system via higher level expressions that are easy to understand, the policy based management concept will fit in well with blockchain ecosystems having stakeholders from different knowledge levels. This model is not only more effective regarding existing off-chain governance models but also is simpler and more user friendly than other on-chain governance models. Besides, the emerging decentralized identity concept has the potential for solving many problems related to decision-making process of blockchain governance. By employing this concept, our approach fortifies decentralization, security and fairness while providing well-directed governance. The smart contract based modular design of our framework opens the door for adoption of its components by other governance models as well.}

Specific planning, operation, and thinking can address this problem with the Internet of things (IoT) and Information Communication Technologies (ICT). Existing research provides various solutions and methods for parking systems in the smart city. However, smart parking has many challenges, such as centralization, communication bandwidth, energy efficiency, integrity, security, and privacy. Inspired by Blockchain and AI technology, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Secure Framework for Energy-Efficient Smart Parking in Sustainable City Environment. The transport layer implements the ECC algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the parking zones data for secure communication. The RSU-based-Blockchain network offers authentication and verification of data at the security layer in a distributed manner. Virtualization technology is used for data storage and provides an energy-efficient environment using virtual machines. With Deep LSTM networks, we analyze the parking zone's data and offer the best parking space to the drivers with the best location and timing. We evaluate the proposed architecture using quantitative, qualitative analysis and provide the driver's best parking space.}

While several applications of this technology exist, the key underlying factor in NFTs’ success is in their potential for investment – buying, selling, and trading the digital assets such as artwork or video game items using cryptocurrency. The rise and mid-2022 crash of NFT and associated crypto markets have shown the volatility of the sector, and questions have been raised around the sustainability, environmental impact, and exploitative practices within this space – and whether there are, in fact, any possible socially responsible use cases for NFTs. This paper aims to fill a gap in the literature surrounding NFTs, primarily through a thorough ethical analysis of the technology and its implementation, deployment, and sustainability. To do this, it uses the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct as a framework for analysis and, following this analysis, makes some recommendations for those wishing to investigate and/or implement NFTs in an ethically responsible manner. The key message is that unless there is absolutely no other way to solve a problem other than using NFTs, then they should not be implemented, as there is currently no ethical use case or means of implementation of NFTs.}

MiC offers a range of benefits including cost-effectiveness, high productivity, and high sustainability for construction industry. Multiple stakeholders in MiC project, such as project client, module manufacturer, logistics company, and building contractor, normally use their own proprietary and centralized Enterprise Information System (EIS). However, stakeholders are facing challenges to share information throughout MiC projects. “Islands of Information” issue is commonly existing and creates information fragmentation and discontinuity. As an emerging Information and Communication Technology (ICT), blockchain provides unified standards and protocols for information sharing based on decentralized P2P framework with enhanced transparency and security. Aiming to address the information fragmentation and discontinuity in MiC project, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart MiC platform to facilitate cross-enterprise information sharing among multiple stakeholders based on User-Centered Design (UCD) method. A practical roadmap is presented for the design, development, deployment, and application of MiC blockchain with new opportunities and guidelines. Initial investigations based on an industrial collaborated company are analyzed and the blockchain-enabled cyber-physical MiC workflow is designed. The user-centered blockchain explorers with high-fidelity digital twins are illustrated. Some preliminary results are found that MiC blockchain not only facilitates cyber-physical construction progress traceability, and real-time KPI visualization & evaluation, but also improves the information reliability, immutability, and transparency in MiC projects.}

To enhance blockchain in the long term, it is crucial to design effective transaction pricing mechanisms. Different from the existing schemes based on auctions with more consideration about the profit of miners, we resort to game theory and propose a correlated equilibrium based transaction pricing mechanism through solving a pricing game among users with transactions, which can achieve both the individual and global optimum. To avoid the computational complexity exponentially increasing with the number of transactions, we further improve the game-theoretic solution with an approximate algorithm, which can derive almost the same results as the original one but costs significantly reduced time. We also propose a truthful assessment model for pricing mechanism to collect the feedback of users regarding the price suggestion. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanism.}

In this chapter, we clarify the meaning of terms used in the blockchain ecosystem and present the results from an extensive literature review from which we summarize current findings. We highlight the principal drivers influencing blockchain adoption—traceability, trust and transparency, supply chain integration, data security, privacy, and sustainability. We note technical, organizational, and regulatory barriers that may inhibit adoption of blockchain in supply chain applications, including scalability, investment costs versus perceived benefits, data sharing and interoperability challenges, and lack of standards or regulations. Although blockchain adoption is still in its early stages, an increasing number of applications are being reported. We identify reported supply chain applications classified by industry sector. This chapter equips scholars and practitioners with an understanding of how blockchain can provide value in contemporary supply chains.}

However, three important challenges need to be addressed to attain long term healthcare-related sustainability – data security, data privacy, and social acceptance of deep learning process. In this paper, we propose a framework that will allow healthcare sustainability through the following contributions 1) ensure privacy of training dataset, 2) support the aggregation of the global model gradients through a private Blockchain-brokered entity, 3) support trustworthiness and provenance of the federated clients by blockchain and off-chain, 4) share the dataset, train the model and share trained model among the federated clients in an encrypted fashion, and 5) add explainability and reasoning of deep learning process to make the model acceptable by the society.

This study addresses the sustainable microgrid design problem by leveraging blockchain technology to provide the real time-based demand response programs. Three sustainable objectives (economy, environment, and society) are formulated by a multi-objective mixed integer-linear programming model. A robust fuzzy multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to determine the optimal number, location, and capacity of renewable distributed generation units as well as the equilibrium supply and dynamic pricing decisions under uncertain demand, capacity, and economic, environmental, and social parameters. The proposed model and solution approach are then applied to a case study in Vietnam. We find that blockchain technology-based sustainable microgrid can result in a 1.68\% and 2.61\% increase of profitability and consumer satisfaction, respectively, and a 0.97\% reduction of environmental impacts.}

Further drought trend analysis is performed based on their mean duration, mean spatial extent, and frequency. Moreover, the drought evolution process which explains the evolution of drought type into another type is also examined. Finally, a blockchain-based framework is proposed to improve the current drought risk management system to facilitate the drought fatalities to get their help and aid as soon as possible. Results demonstrate that hydrological and soil moisture droughts are observed to be more influential as compared to the other two drought types in most of the river basins of India. Further, it was found that 82\% of concurrent droughts involve soil moisture drought in 16 out of 25 river basins.

It has some excellent features, which makes it a promising application for the smart grid paradigm. A smart grid is a developing technology for electricity and data transmission through lines and controls for on-demand power supplies. By combining the internet of things and advanced sensors, the smart grid could be a feasible solution for uninterrupted power/electricity supplies in the near future. However, many adoption issues in the smart grid, such as data security and privacy concerns, are the biggest challenges in the power supply’s data utilization and operations for energy consumption. In order to eliminate these challenges, newer and novel technology is needed. For that, blockchain technology is one of the possible solutions for enabling the smart grid.

abstract = {Blockchain is a buzzword describing the current excitement for an innovative technology that could change and disrupt major industries and economic sectors. Blockchain technology has the promise to change all existing business models and make financial services cheaper contributing therefore to a better financial inclusion and, even a better economic wealth distribution. Numerous studies optimistically praise such potential societal benefits by listing all processes that could be optimized through this technology. However, the picture is not necessary all bright. Blockchain can indeed disrupt and significantly improve our societies but there still exist some societal costs in the way this technology is implemented. This paper provides a perspective overviewing of the current trends related to the development of the most widely used implementation of blockchain technology based on the proof-of-work consensus algorithm. These trends will be discussed in three steps: the ‘Good Blockchain’ overviews how this technology can improve our societies; the ‘Bad blockchain’ offers a more nuanced perspective by discussing the potential polluting activities generated by some mining activities. Finally, the ‘Ugly blockchain’ investigates how this technology might generate a risk of concentration in the mining industry affecting therefore the nature and even the existence of the blockchain technology.}

The application of such technologies as blockchain, Internet-of-Things, wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, and machine learning can improve the agri-food supply chain efficiency and quality management. However, there is little evidence on the determinants of blockchain integrated ICTs adoption for the supply chain actors and their propensity to embrace and use such technologies. To bridge this research gap in the literature, we identify a few potential drivers of blockchain technology adoption, considering the grape wine supply chain and employing a rating-based conjoint analysis. The study finds that dis-intermediation, traceability, price, trust, compliance, and coordination and control in order of their relative importance and utilities can influence the supply chain actors’ adoption-intention decision processes. The adoption factors further rationalize the design for a modular, scalable, interoperable, and cost-effective architecture for supply chain integration and sustainability.}

Misaligned incentives in different principal – agent scenarios are important risk factors from governance point of view. With blockchain, these misalignments are accounted for algorithmically, therefore novel governance models are possible. What role do risks play in terms of deciding for, or against the adoption of blockchain? How to best define requirements to achieve it? This paper explores standards and risk as factors, which can support or hinder the sustained application of blockchain in a broad scope of environments. We conducted a systematic literature review that outlines a current understanding of perceived risk surrounding the adoption and use of blockchain technology in the context of requirements engineering. Furthermore, selected models for managing risks are presented. Finally, areas where deeper research is required are identified. We conclude that a gap exists in normative frameworks that affect the adoption and sustainable use of blockchain technology. Closing this gap can support the sustainable use of blockchain technology.}

A blockchain is simply a distributed database. The technology is being used for a wide range of applications relevant to economic exchange and environmental sustainability. Many degrowth scholars wholly reject technical fixes for politically induced environmental crises, seeing blockchain projects as wasteful and counter to convivial social relations. Others highlight the technology's potential for facilitating redistributive and regenerative economies, but without much detail. This paper argues that if blockchain is ever to prove useful for the degrowth movement it would need to overcome challenges in three important areas: 1) building democratic and (re)distributive economies, 2) regenerating the environment without commodifying it, and 3) facilitating international alliances without imposing a particular set of values. What is certain is that technology on its own will not transcend the political struggles tackled by degrowth activists. However, under certain conditions, blockchain might make those struggles more effective.}

Supporting energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges in a community of prosumers. We demonstrate how smart contracts can manage energy transactions and enable a more secured trading environment between consumers and producers. We utilise data and models from a real fish processing industrial site in Milford Haven Port, South Wales, based on which we validate our research hypothesis.}

The results show that the number of publications about blockchain technology in the energy sector have been skyrocketing, especially since 2018, which indicates the combining blockchain technology with energy sector is a new cross-cutting research area with increasing attention. At the national level, developing countries begin to move to the world stage, catching up or even surpassing several traditional developed countries in the field of energy blockchain. Cluster analysis results show that the existing energy blockchain research focuses on renewable energy, trying to solve the bottlenecks in its development process, and providing better solutions for the replacement of fossil energy by renewable energy. We therefore contend that blockchain may be fueling the renewable energy and powering our energy sustainability. Finally, the possible future development trend of energy blockchain is offered.}

However, in SG networks the components communicate over insecure public channels, raising severe security concerns. Likewise, the security challenge is growing more difficult with the introduction of virtual solutions in SG networks. Thus, we devise a new scheme, named lightweight authenticated key exchange scheme for a blockchain-enabled SG environment (LAKE-BSG), which permits secure communication among smart meters (SMs) and service providers (SPs). In the proposed scheme, data is kept secured in a blockchain network. SPs are liable for verifying new blocks in the private blockchain through a consensus algorithm. We provide a detailed security analysis of LAKE-BSG through informal security analysis, formal security analysis using the real oracle model, and formal security verification using the Scyther tool. The results demonstrate that the devised scheme is resilient towards various security attacks in an SG environment. Furthermore, an exhaustive comparative analysis reveals that LAKE-BSG is efficient in terms of communication and computation overheads and provides additional security and functionality features.}

First, with much of the world’s “easy oil” already consumed, the companies behind geoenergy will have to use increasingly sophisticated technologies to find and deliver these energy sources to the market. Second, the expectations placed upon the geoenergy sector by many of its stakeholders have grown considerably with regards to environmental stewardship, safety, and human welfare. In the face of these kinds of challenges, the industry will require an increasing degree of technological and commercial sophistication to continue to be a part of the world’s sustainable energy mix. Blockchain has emerged as a promising innovation that could potentially play an important role in delivering the kinds of technological and commercial capabilities that the geoenergy sector will need to achieve these ends. In spite of the myriad ways that blockchain could potentially improve the efficiency and sustainability of the geoenergy industry, however, the technology is still evolving, and a few barriers stand in the way of its widespread deployment. This paper puts forward case study evidence from the Intel Corporation and the Energistics Consortium showing what the geoenergy sector can learn about blockchain from other industries, and highlights that the absence of data standards and interoperability has contributed to blockchain’s failure to deliver significant value in the geoenergy domain thus far.}

However, microgrids closely located to demand areas cannot easily balance power supply and demand owing to the intermittency of renewable energy generation and the barriers to connecting with the main electricity grid. To overcome this problem, this study addresses a sustainable microgrid design problem, where blockchain technology is used for peer-to-peer energy trading in the microgrid. The adoption of the blockchain technology in peer-to-peer energy trading ensures the security and sustainability for participants in the microgrid. It enables the participants to take control of the energy system without the need for a central regulatory authority. The problem entails decisions regarding not only the power flow among entities in the grid and the number, location, and capacity of renewable distributed generation units but also the price mechanism for peer-to-peer trading. A sustainable network microgrid is modeled by considering economic and environmental objectives with social constraints related to maximizing demand satisfaction of consumers. A fuzzy multi-objective programming model is proposed to tackle the variability in the capacity of renewable distributed generation units and demand load. The proposed model is solved by a genetic algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed model in decision-making regarding microgrid design, the impact of peer-to-peer trading on the total profit of the microgrid, and the applicability of the developed solution approach.}

Ronald Coase has proposed the most efficient market-based approach to the problem of social costs. This approach has introduced the concept of limited right to perform activities harmful to the third party and provided basis for a peer-to-peer (P2P) settlement of reciprocal damage. Decentralized P2P approach is necessary for evaluation of negative impact costs and mitigation benefits. Advance of decentralized arbitration technologies, such as Blockchain, crucially decreases transaction costs for P2P interactions and thus provides for further development of Coase paradigm. Application of Blockchain technology to mitigat collateral socio-environmental damage of economic activities relies on a concept of decentralized P2P and public evaluation of negative impact, distribution of liability, and settlement in the form of mitigation. Decentralized autonomous organization integral platform for climate initiatives (DAO IPCI) is designed to be truly decentralized public Blockchain-ecosystem and aims at creation of common business space to attract financing from investors not limited by financial capacity, location, or legal status with minimization of transaction costs, increased reliability and transparency of the whole process, which would be free of interference, interventions, manipulations, or falsifications.

Unfavourable support of top management and the lack of technology competence were the main barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology among manufacturing firms. The results indicate that firms did not achieve low carbon performance and that a lack of pressure from competitors and technical competency to undertake blockchain technology were factors. No evidence existed demonstrating a linkage of early adopters of blockchain technology with and low carbon performance. Recommendations of this study include that firms should take the initiative to record the energy consumption, engage in the transfer of carbon credits, and monitor carbon performance using reliable technology to improve business transparency and sustainability.}

abstract = {The growing integration of distributed generations and battery storage equipped with smart meters paves a way to smartly manage the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) using a digital platform to improve the overall performance of the microgrid system. The deployment of distributed energy resources, particularly solar photovoltaic and wind generation, has transformed conventional power consumers into active prosumers. As a result of the expansion and digitalization of power distribution infrastructures, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy intra-trading has evolved as a new paradigm in electricity trade in the community microgrid system. Blockchain is being used to encourage P2P energy intra-trading amongst prosumers, consumers, and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) owners because of its transparency, security, and speed in completing transactions. This P2P concept is further extended in this work to establish a self-sustained community microgrid system in energy trading with a case study to showcase the merits of blockchain technology in providing a secure and effective trading platform for mass users. As a result, the proposed work presents a solution for a secured energy management system that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized microgrid energy market model that depicts P2P energy transactions with the incorporation of a battery storage system. Again, the microgrid P2P market settles the clearing price considering the probable response of customers when the price varies and incentive is paid to customers and prosumers to change the pattern of using of loads. According to the findings, end-users benefit from energy savings and self-sufficiency due to the combination of automated P2P trade and storage flexibility. Furthermore, a sort of crypto-currency “Cosmos (Atom)” is simulated in the P2P market model and published via the blockchain's mining mechanism. The proposed design framework presented in this paper has addressed the implementation of an effective energy management platform for developing a self-sustained microgrid system using distributed energy resources.}

The objectives of this research are firstly, to map the milk supply chains to explore information flow among different members for higher traceability; secondly, to investigate the societal impacts of blockchain technology in a milk supply chain to build social sustainability. The systems theory in integration with system dynamics (SD) provides the necessary theoretical underpinning to this research. We collect data from an agricultural development cooperative founded to support dairy farmers in Turkey. This work evaluates the societal impacts of blockchain technology on farmers, the community and animals using parameters such as local embedding, rural development, decreasing food fraud, animal health and welfare, proximity to food markets, food security, educating and promoting people towards healthy eating, assisting food access and social acceptability for transparency. In the last 18 years, the cooperative has encouraged dairy farmers in the district to become partners with a resultant increase in milk production from 30 thousand tons in 2002 to 330 thousand tons in 2019. According to our findings, population growth of the country and adult population increases in the district, it is expected that by 2025 the number of partners will rise to approximately 2800. The increase in number of partners proves the network expansion. Furthermore, blockchain technology can be incorporated into the existing system so that transparent and end-to-end accurate tracking of the supply chain is made possible, while creating decentralized recording of transactions. Moreover, the critical traceability points of a milk supply chain are evaluated with the blockchain adoption. This will help achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of providing safe food, promoting good health and better well-being for everyone.}

However, production of these gases is not always as transparent or environmentally friendly as perceived, so with the aid of certification and blockchain, we can create a system that can guarantee their environmentally positive origin, and ultimately help assist the transition to a greener future. This paper explores the varying production methods, with consideration to their environmental impact, and the implications of the use of certificates and blockchain to monitor production, trade and usage.}

The overriding goal of such developments is really to foster the development of a sustainable society. Nevertheless, connecting and managing the rapidly rising number of users and connections seems to be a challenge in the existing centralized grid architecture. As a result, the smart grid is evolving from a centralized to a decentralized topology. On the other hand, the blockchain offers several advantageous features of a packaged software ready to be unpacked and installed which can benefit smart grid paradigm.

In this paper, exchange of highly sensitive information in a more transparent and secure way and to avoid the misunderstandings and trust issues between the enterprises a smart contractbased on blockchain technology has been proposed in case of a distributed manufacturingenvironment. Here, we used a public-permission less Ethereum platform to execute the smart contracts in the Blockchain to process the customer orders and to identify the right enterprise. Later, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for optimal resource sharing and scheduling in a considered sustainable DMS. The objectives of the proposed model consist of simultaneously improvement of the performance measures such as makespan, machine utilization, energy consumption, and reliability. To solve this MILP model, a new Multi-objective-based Hybridized Moth Flame Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm (HMFEO) is developed and then the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). The results obtained from implementing the model using experimental data along with different cases show the efficiency and the validity of the proposed model and solution approach. Moreover, several performance indicators like hyper volume are increased by nearly 15–20 \% that shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm with the NSGA-III.}

Such goodwill is based on expectations for superior quality and ethically functioning agricultural supply chains. Trust in FT ecolabels must be earned however: traceability, accountability, transparency, fair flow of returns, and ecological sustainability are some of the important attributes likely to enhance trust. Blockchain technology (BCT) promises to improve all of these aspects over common marketing strategies. The literature suggests that the potential benefits from BCT adoption in food supply chains outweigh the numerous barriers identified. We thus interview New Zealand and Australian FT representatives (n = 6) about this disruptive technology and measure their readiness to adopt BCT using the Technology Readiness Index (TRI). We also contrast their views with those of BCT experts (n = 6). Our thematic content analysis identifies 33 nodes which we have grouped into five main themes: conditional benefits of BCT adoption, positive and negative consequences from transparency, factors pertaining to consumer behaviour, and implementation barriers. Although the TRI analytic results suggested that the positive views on the opportunities BCT may provide for FT goals prevail, the overall sentiment of both interviewee groups suggests that actual BCT adoption is currently not feasible.}

abstract = {The complexity of the supply chain, with a multiplicity of suppliers and organizations imposes challenges to its traceability, affecting the possibility of making it more sustainable. The declaration of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) by companies has been a response to pressures from stakeholders and regulations towards a sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). However, there are still some setbacks. The verification process of the inventories is a time-consuming task and the utilization of traditional renewable energy certificates can cause distortions in the perception of those who are consuming renewable energy but are not buying certificates. A blockchain-based application could address those problems by tracking transparent records of product history. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based artifact in the form of a level 1 architecture diagram to improve the Brazil GHG Protocol Program inventory process on scope 2, which includes indirect carbon emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam; main supply chain components. Using the Design Science Research (DSR) approach, we combine knowledge from business participants and environmental experts to understand the Program problems, propose and evaluate the artifact, and analyze its contributions. We find out that not all actors may want greater transparency in the supply chain and that traditional certificate issuers are expected to resist, while a new generation of blockchain-based certificates challenges the more traditional competitors. Additionally, the economic benefits observed in implementing blockchain points out that the organization and resistance of the actors, therefore, could be as important as costs in the implementation of new technologies in supply chains. There are two main contributions from this study. First, it introduces the discussion on blockchain adoption in the GHG Protocol Program. Second, it uses DSR as an instrument to both articulate a solution around a theoretical artifact and make its potential contribution understandable for actors not familiar with blockchain technologies. We propose that future studies could: (i) produce a proof-of-concept or a pilot implementation of this artifact; (ii) include other actors from the energy and trading certificates chain on the artifact, such as energy producers, regulators and the Brazilian Electricity Trading Chamber (CCEE); (iii) reproduce the same proposition focusing on GHG Protocol’s scope 3.}

In this study, a blockchain enhanced price incentive demand response (DR) is proposed for demand side management. The building users are as price anticipators, whose energy purchasing is a determinant factor for energy price. All building users can actively immigrate the shiftable electric loads into the valley time and cut down the cuttable thermal loads, as the response to the price scheme. Moreover, the information and energy interactions between building users are formulated as a non-cooperative game, the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) is proved. To avoid privacy leakage, each building user is assigned a pseud digital identity and all transactions are conducted by an anonymous operation. To guarantee the credibility of the optimal energy schedule, data verification is proposed to verify the truth of the data executed by each building user. The data maintained by all building users is transparent, traceable, and tamper-resistant. Finally, the empirical study shows that the proposed blockchain enhanced framework is effective for optimal energy scheduling, credibility, and security of the building user energy network. That is extremely significant for sustainable cities and society.}

The presented LEM is based on an automated market-making mechanism. Buying and selling prices are dynamically determined by the amount of energy consumed and produced within a local energy community. We implemented the market in a blockchain application based on the Cosmos framework, which was deployed on embedded devices in a test pilot consisting of 18 residential buildings in Southern Switzerland. The sustainability of the application was investigated by analyzing the resources required by the blockchain to operate. The obtained results show how the developed application uses a small part of the resources of the embedded devices, approximately 100 MB for the memory usage and about 4\% as regards the CPU. Thus, while the application deployment on smart meters is still troublesome, especially for memory requirements, the deployment at the data concentrator level is reasonable and feasible. Finally, we propose possible improvements and extensions that can be implemented in future versions of the presented solution.}

Platforms based on blockchain technology combined with Internet-of-Things technology have emerged to address these challenges by improving supply chain visibility, guaranteeing the execution of contracts, and increasing the authenticity of products’ provenance information in the ASC. This study analyzes how the adoption of a blockchain-based platform can affect the decisions of ASC participants and identifies how the platform creates value for the supply chain by addressing these three challenges. We consider a two-level supply chain featuring a typical cooperative and a buyer and establish stylized game models with and without the blockchain-based platform. By comparing equilibrium outcomes with and without the blockchain-based platform, we show that the involvement of the blockchain-based platform can lead to increased production quantity and total surplus of the supply chain. This can also motivate more sustainability/green investment to produce greener products. Interestingly, we show that the value of the blockchain-based platform decreases in the credibility of the business environment in which the supply chain operates. Furthermore, the buyer will always benefit from the established blockchain-based platform, whereas the cooperative can benefit in most cases but could be worse off under certain conditions. The adoption and operational costs could outweigh the benefits caused by the addition of the blockchain-based platform.}

abstract = {Sustainability in cross-border logistics requires issues such as fragmented management to be addressed. Particular challenges arise in cross-border logistics in modular construction (CLMC) because supervision is inefficient, primarily due to continued use of paper-based documentation. Researchers have developed digital platforms that integrate accurate prefabricated module location information but their centralized operation creates information security issues such as tampering. Blockchain technology can overcome this limitation but relies on user participation. This study, therefore, develops a blockchain-based supervision (BBS) model with incentives for application in CLMC. The BBS model is developed using a design science research approach to enhance supervision of CLMC and motivate users to share data promptly, and then a prototype system is developed and evaluated in a CLMC case. The results show that the system brings a positive change in product accountability (df = 8, t = 0.6601, p = 0.528) compared with current paper-based recording process (df = 8, t = 0.0035, p = 0.997), and a positive change in data traceability (df = 8, t = 1.468, p = 0.180) compared with existing process (df = 8, t = 0.042, p = 0.967). In addition, this study obtains higher scores (552) than others in evaluating the incentive mechanisms. The security analysis is also discussed through data immutability, non-repudiation, authentication, and authorization. The ﬁndings of this study pave the way for a tamper-proof, incentive-enabled supervision mechanism in modular construction.}

To better understand mechanisms that may encourage honest electronics end-of-life management, we develop a framework to analyze the decision calculus of electronic waste recyclers facing a decision between an honest choice that might be more expensive or a dishonest choice that saves money but has some probability of being caught. Building an analytical decision tree model under which a recycler maximizes expected returns, we explore the influence of supervision on the choices a recycler faces and provide an analytical solution that describes the boundaries that separate those choices. Using our framework, we systematically catalog which interventions may help and which may not. The model suggests that direct unqualified subsidies to recyclers may not be particularly effective, although properly targeted subsidies have promise. We also find that there are substitution effects between increasing the cost of fraud and decreasing the costs of proper electronic waste recycling. That is, increasing the cost of fraud can serve as a policy instrument to produce effects similar to decreasing a recycler’s costs from engaging in honest behavior. We also discuss the role of digital fraud prevention technologies such as blockchain as another mechanism to help achieve sustainability outcomes in e-waste management while lowering the costs of third-party supervision.}

abstract = {Social sustainability is a major concern in global supply chains for protecting workers from exploitation and for providing a safe working environment. Although there are stipulated standards to govern supply chain social sustainability, it is not uncommon to hear of businesses being reported for noncompliance issues. Even reputable firms such as Unilever have been criticized for production labor exploitation. Consumers now increasingly expect sellers to disclose information on social sustainability, but sellers are confronted with the challenge of traceability in their multi-tier global supply chains. Blockchain offers a promising future to achieve instant traceability in supply chain social sustainability. This study develops a system architecture that integrates the use of blockchain, internet-of-things (IoT) and big data analytics to allow sellers to monitor their supply chain social sustainability efficiently and effectively. System implementation cost and potential challenges are analyzed before the research is concluded.}

Through qualitative content analysis, expert interviews and discussion rooted in recent literature, key insights on the practical challenges and opportunities of blockchain energy applications are investigated. This is done in technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions in order to propose holistic insights. Key dentified issues include scalability, data privacy, costs of change, market dynamics, user experience, skills, multi-stakeholder governance, and regulatory change. Key identified opportunities also range across these dimensions, such as blockchain advancements, power market development, user research, and regulatory sandboxes. While most research on blockchain energy applications has been from the technological lens, this paper contributes with a multi-dimensional approach. The interrelatedness among these dimensions is one of the key messages of this paper. Both corporate strategy and public policy development need to integrate user behavior research, business model innovation and regulatory experimentation for a holistic approach in understanding and implementing blockchain, and other emerging technologies. It is suggested that the multi-dimensional challenges and opportunities identified in this study, and functioning of their interrelatedness, are of interest for further exploration both in academia and among practitioners.}

In this study, six cases of blockchain-based technologies in the food supply chain were analyzed applying a technology assessment framework that distinguishes between four different components of a technology: technique, knowledge, organization, and product. The study intends to provide new critical insights on how blockchain-based technologies can be implemented in the food supply chain and to further the discussion of social and environmental implications of blockchain-based technologies. The results highlight how blockchain is not a stand-alone-technology, but rather one element in a system of technologies. While blockchain-based technologies are expected to bring a variety of impacts, only some are directly attributable to the blockchain element: increased transparency, traceability, and trust. Other impacts such as improved data management are a side-effect of digitizing non-digital processes. Further research is needed to confirm whether blockchain-based technologies bring the expected sustainability improvements in food supply chains.}

However, little is known about the benefits and impact of BCT on the tea supply chain and its sustainable performance. To bridge this gap, this study extends the resource-based view (RBV) and network theory (NT) by integrating BCT into the tea supply chain. We develop a conceptual model of a BCT-driven tea supply chain, which we analyse using a partial least squares regression-based structural equation modelling method with data collected from 305 experts in India. The findings show that the use of BCT has a significant positive effect on the tea supply chain; in particular, transparency and reliability are shown as the sustainable performance parameters. The implementation of BCT is a progressive paradigm shift that encourages actors to change their attitudes and become more competent in the tea sector. This study is the first report on integrating BCT into supply chains, contributing to the scant literature on this subject. Furthermore, our conceptual framework could help develop a more sustainable supply chain for the global tea industry.}

It covers the airport industry from the perspective of sustainable performance and data analysis by reading and processing financial statements, non-financial reports, and the website of one strategic airport infrastructure in southern Italy. The Italian airport infrastructure investigated successfully adopted the Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) platform. This is one of the main blockchain technology applications in the airport industry. It promotes cooperation between the main players in the aviation industry and the air traffic controllers (ATCs) to reduce fragmentation, inefficiency, and uncoordinated operations. It also allows information and data sharing, but it is still not possible to observe a high level of sustainable performance. Although the adoption of blockchain technology presents numerous benefits, especially in improving OM, these new technological solutions do not guarantee the achievement of the best performance in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability issues. Managers and policy makers need to work together to create a real forum within their collaborative network in which there is a common culture and mutual trust. This article adds an interesting reading of blockchain technology to the existing research with concerns about OM and sustainability issues within the airport setting in Italy.}

Sustainable production appears as a strategic route to combat these adversities, the pursuit of which is highly challenging. In this study, we argue that Intellectual capital (IC), featured by human capital, relational capital, and structural capital, can play a dual role in improving the sustainable production of a firm. We put forward that IC contributes to sustainable production directly and indirectly through the adoption of blockchain-driven supply chain management (BCSCM). In this context, the objective of this study is to examine the impact of intellectual capital (IC) on sustainable production. The study also investigates the role of SC mapping and BCSCM in the association between IC and sustainable production. Data were collected from 289 textile firms of Pakistan and Bangladesh with the help of a designed questionnaire. The study employed CB-SEM to examine the modeled relationship. Further, PLS-Multi-group Analysis (MGA) was used for cross-country comparison of the results. The results diverge from the conventional wisdom exhibiting an insignificant direct impact of IC in sustainable production. Nevertheless, the results show a meaningful indirect effect of IC through BCSCM and SC mapping on sustainable production. Results also exhibit a significant direct impact of BCSCM on the sustainable production of a firm. The results call for consideration of IC and BCSCM in improving the sustainability of a firm.}

Furthermore, we show how our research results, advancing the State-of-the-Art in the IoT and blockchain interactions, can support the interests of a diverse set of water management stakeholders in a concrete use-case implementation. To assess our contribution and validate our results we use a system architecture comprising constrained IoT devices for measuring water consumption used as direct data-source actors, a public blockchain infrastructure, and smart contracts that represent the interests of different water management stakeholders and regulate the distribution of incentives amongst virtuous farmers. Further validation on the usability of our results is obtained through the real implementation of a complete use case featuring the Ethereum network as a public blockchain and where six different types of IoT platforms are individually assessed for impact on the IoT devices, in terms of energy, processing time, and available memory. The findings show how solutions based on the proposed architecture can be implemented with only 6\% of additional energy budget compared to the normal operations of the IoT devices. Besides showing new means to energy-efficiently integrate IoT data sources in a permissionless blockchain, the validation results make our contribution a strong candidate for use in automated and incentive-based irrigation water management systems as well as a key component in fostering increased sustainability of the whole agricultural sector.}

It serves as a solution to the problems of energy supply in the future by means of the combination of Internet of Things technology and Wireless Sensor Networks. In this path, to make sure that energy should be made available anywhere at any instance, Energy Internet is rising as an innovative solution. These innovations ultimately aim to create a sustainable society. Yet, the integration and syncing of relatively large amount of increasing interconnection may become a challenge related to the conventional centralised grid structure. Similarly, protection and confidentiality problems in the utilization and trade of electricity statistics pose significant challenges to implementation of the smart grid. Therefore, from its centralised form, the smart grid undergoes a transition from its centralised form to the decentralised topology. Blockchain Technology has some outstanding features for applicability in the promising smart grid idea. Here, we present a detailed study on blockchain based smart grid application. We studied a range of recent blockchain centred research works accessible in various literature dealing with safety concerns associated in smart grid idea in order to be solved by blockchain. It also summarises a range of similar realistic designs, trials and solutions that have recently emerged. Use case in each area is studied to identify effective blockchain architecture, type of block structure and associated technologies. The energy trading process can be enhanced by using credit-based payment system. Effective record aggregation systems using blockchain technology needs to be considered to solve the confidentiality and safety problems of the grid. Energy allocation systems can distantly manage the power stream in a specific region by tracking the usage data for that sector by blockchain. Finally, the key research concerns and future directions for blockchain application to smart grid security problems are addressed.}

Based on this mapping we distinguish three archetypes of smallholder participation engendered by digital technology that we label ‘the tutorial’, ‘the dashboard’ and ‘the platform’. The archetypes provide a basis for understanding how digitalization, as a process of design-based governance, can overcome, replicate or even reinforce the barriers to participation faced by analog sustainability initiatives. Applied more widely we argue this typology can provide a productive means of examining the role of digitalization in contributing to more inclusive and sustainable food systems.}

Most of previous research studies employed the AI and the BT separately with limited efforts providing a conceptual view for possible convergence in real-life applications. Nevertheless, such efforts do not address construction applications. This research introduces a novel tailorable decentralized AI system that utilizes BT as a computing-oriented technology. The proposed system is developed as an inference engine while having a number of interesting features. First, the system validates and audits the decision-making process while sharing and recording the input data and the computed outcomes in a synchronized trusted manner. Second, the system allows the formation of distributed AI repository that can absorb and manage concurrent use-cases while targeting different scopes and covering diverse AI branches. Third, it provides a workable solution for the AI applications' distribution problem, which hinders their wide employment. Fourth, the introduced system guarantees sustainable versioning and evolution over time for AI applications based on their performance or the newly acquired data. A case study of estimating the construction cost for road projects is provided to illustrate the system’s workability and demonstrate its performance.}

A defective drug is a highly detrimental issue, as it can cost several lives. Therefore, recalling the drug becomes one of the most sensitive issues in the pharmaceutical industry. This paper presents a blockchain-enabled network that allows manufacturers to effectively monitor a drug while in the supply chain with improved security and transparency throughout the process. The study also tries to minimize the cost and time sustained by the manufacturing company to transfer the drug to the end-user by proposing forward and backward supply chain mathematical models. Specifically, the forward chain model supports drug delivery from the manufacturer to the end-user in less time with a reliable transport mode. The backward supply chain model explicitly focuses on reducing the extra time and cost incurred to the manufacturer in pursuit of recalling the defective drug. Moreover, a real-time implementation of the proposed blockchain-enabled supply chain management system using the Hyperledger Composer is done to demonstrate the transparency of the process.}

The challenges encountered in implementing smart building projects in Bahrain were examined for the first time in this study. It is hypothesized that there are no statistically significant differences in the level of response with SBP characteristics and challenges between respondents according to their experience, affiliation, and project type. A questionnaire was distributed to professional engineers and the quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Structure Equation Modelling (SEM) to test the research hypotheses. The experience and affiliation did not affect the response level with SBP characteristics and challenges while the project type did with a 95\% confidence level. Overcoming the challenges, enhancing awareness, clarifying purpose objectives, creating standards, and opening a deep discussion about SBP in Bahrain should occur and further improvements to the SBP sector could be achieved in Bahrain by studying digital building twins and blockchain technology for performance-based smart contracts.}

However, challenges such as security, privacy, trust, scalability, verifiability, and centralization prevent faster adaptations of IoT-driven smart cities. Thus, in this paper, a Trustworthy Privacy-Preserving Secured Framework (TP2SF) for smart cities is presented. This framework includes three modules namely: a trustworthiness module, a two-level privacy module, and an intrusion detection module. In trustworthiness module, address-based blockchain reputation system is designed. In the two-level privacy module, a blockchain based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is simultaneously applied with Principal Component analysis (PCA) to transform data into a new reduced shape for preventing inference and poisoning attacks. In the intrusion detection module, an optimized gradient tree boosting system (XGBoost) is deployed. Finally, due to inherited strengths and weaknesses of Fog–Cloud architecture, we present a blockchain-IPFS integrated Fog–Cloud infrastructure namely, CloudBlock and FogBlock to deploy proposed TP2SF framework in smart city. The TP2SF framework is evaluated using two realistic IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. The findings indicate the superiority of TP2SF framework over other state-of-the-art techniques in both nonblockchain and blockchain systems.}

This research narrows the knowledge gap by prioritizing the important barriers using a fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation of Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Pairwise comparison data were collected from three representative organizations in China, which all have Blockchain implementation experiences. The results show that the key cause barriers are immaturity of technology, and technical challenges for collecting supply chain data in real time. The prominent barriers include lack of new organizational policies for using technology, and lack of government policy/regulation guidance and support, among others. Managerial implications are discussed based on the results and findings.}

While blockchain technologies provide a helpful mechanism in the form of technical consensus, originally created to resolve the double-spending problem, little does it address impediments to proper contract formation that have to do with the quality of exogenous data, asymmetry of information, or even its suitability (the colloquial garbage-in/garbage-out problem). In the face of the limitations of technical consensus, we explore how the strengths of technical consensus can be utilized by introducing another dimension of consensus – what we have called social consensus – which directly addresses the formation of true (if retrospective) Common Knowledge essential to arms-length agreement between multiple actors. We have eschewed the notion that social consensus as an epistemological concern, and instead focus on mechanisms by which environments of multiple actors form and sustain bodies of information that enable them to go about their activities with a reasonable level of confidence that others in the supply chain will ‘do their bit,’ backed by a ‘failsafe’ mechanism enforced by cryptography which holds the actors unharmed in case the envisioned finality is not obtained. These bodies of information create what is essentially a retrospective form of common knowledge, and a lesser variant, mutual knowledge. We propose an implementation from the preferred mechanism of a multisig primitive, which builds and improves on the Gnosis multisig, in the use case of decentralized blockchain-powered supply chains consisting of multiple parties, human and machine.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
The agri-food system is undergoing pervasive changes in business models, facilitated by the use of digital technologies. Although today it is almost inevitable for any business to adopt some level of digital transformation to strengthen their competitiveness, this transition in the agri-food sector could be more complex, given its characteristics.
OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study is to analyse worldwide the perceptions of new digital technologies in the agri-food sector expressed within social media platforms, identifying the differences that may exist between them regarding its objectives and social acceptance.
METHODS
This paper examines the information regarding digital transformation process in the agri-food sector disseminated worldwide on Twitter. For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather tweets and descriptive and content analyses, including a sentiment analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector is broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these information flows, being companies and digital solution providers the most active users and academics and governmental institutions the most visible. Artificial Intelligence was the most mentioned technology, that together with the Internet of Things, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production efficiencies, crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology, it was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies and marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the concept of sustainability. The sentiment analysis showed a generally positive tone, indicating social acceptance regarding the starting phase of the adoption of these technologies. The study also identified differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the sector all over the world.
SIGNIFICANCE
Our results demonstrate that data harvested from Twitter provide useful insight into perceptions of digital transformation and different digital technologies in the agri-food value chain across different countries. Information that could be useful for researchers, but also for agricultural firms and policymakers.}

Several models have been introduced to conceptualize and calculate the urban energy system, and to demonstrate the variants that calibrate the local energy efficiency. Nevertheless, cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, electrical -and even autonomous- vehicles, smart building systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data etc. are growing within cities and question the identified urban energy efficiency, since they demand enormous amounts of power. In this regard, policy makers are concerned of the emerging technologies’ energy efficiency and their impact on the urban energy system and they attempt to introduce corresponding standards for their development. This article focuses on the impact of AI and big data in city's energy efficiency. More specifically, a literature analysis is performed and returned a taxonomy of existing energy efficiency assessment models under the lens of AI and big data. Moreover, the definition of a unified assessment model for AI and big data energy efficiency is approached.}

abstract = {The early days of cyberspace expansion saw many people hesitant to use the internet for two dominant reasons: obscurity and skepticism. Yet, the internet soon became a one-stop solution to a diverse range of sectors, where a need to resolve issues such as data confidentiality and integrity gained prime importance. In 2008, an online currency called Bitcoin was launched by an anonymous developer or developer community called Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was deemed to be a viable alternative to fiat or government-issued currency. What made Bitcoin famous and easily adaptable was the ease of accessibility in the form of a device application or simply “wallet” that included the nodes or “blocks” on which transaction data would be stored and processed instantaneously and the intention behind it to create a trustworthy cash system that would give individuals complete ownership of their transactions, not at risk of security breaches. With the advent and success of Bitcoin, new doors opened for other cryptocurrencies and digital assets like Ethereum and Litecoin, and it was observed that unlike fiduciary money, the sustainability of a thorough and transparent record must be maintained in connection with the exchange of digitalized money between any two parties whose anonymity would be preserved. Eventually, this became a turning point and marked the beginning of blockchain technology, which functioned as a distributed ledger system ensuring secure transactions given its strong and complex cryptographic background strengthened with the help of hashing techniques and timestamps. Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database as a part of the implementation, and the technology synchronized all transactions across multiple geographies in a peer-to-peer network (P2P) without the involvement of mediating authorities like a bank or payments processing company. Having received extensive attention, blockchains revolve around a fundamental concept that transactions are clustered into blocks and exchanged and checked by a network of nodes in the distributed environment with mutual agreement or consensus. To achieve this, consensus algorithms are implemented to instill certainty regarding user security and ledger consistency in a distributed network. Over time, this technology penetrated spheres other than virtual currency management. It showed the unimaginable potential to eliminate enormous amounts of record organization and storage problems, streamlining supply chains, making blockchain unarguably the most important innovation since the emergence of artificial intelligence.}

Technological advances manifested in approaches such as deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and Blockchain are of substantial importance throughout HSCs and are understood as competitive advantages. Furthermore, applying advanced performance evaluation techniques, including DEA in HSCs for enhancing performance has attracted momentous attention over the last two decades. To make use of these approaches, a network DEA (NDEA) model and a deep learning approach are developed to predict the sustainability of HSCs. The developed model in this paper can determine the optimal value of bounded connections. Using the DEA capabilities, the threshold of each of these bounded connections is obtained to maximize the efficiency of decision making units (DMUs). It also identifies the role of the dual-role connections for each DMU. The results show that HSCs that use the least facilities and have the most desirable output, as well as the least undesirable output, are in the top ranks.}

To cope up these issues there exists, the energy cloud management (ECM) system, which combines the infrastructure for energy, with intelligent energy usage and value-added services as per consumers demand. To achieve these, efficient demand-side forecasting and secure data transmission are the key factors. The energy management issues pose extreme gravity in finding sustainable solutions by using the blockchain (BC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI-based techniques support various services such as energy load prediction, classification of the consumer, load management, and analysis where the BC provides data immutability and trust mechanism for secure energy management. Therefore, this paper reviews several existing AI-based approaches along with the advantages and challenges of integrating the BC technology and AI in the ECM system. We presented a decentralized AI-based ECM framework for energy management using BC and validate it using a case study. It is shown that how BC and AI can be used to mitigate ECM with security and privacy issues. Finally, we highlighted the open research issues and challenges of the BC-AI-based ECM system.}

Industrial knowledge graph and cognitive intelligence play an important role in designing incentive mechanisms for BSMN. Based on the evolutionary game theory, this paper designs various incentive models and develops the corresponding smart contracts to encourage different enterprises to participate in the “accounting” operations, to enhance the trust and maintain the operational stability of BSMN. Firstly, the evolution mechanism of BSMN was analyzed. Then, an evolutionary game model between shared manufacturing enterprise nodes was established to deduce the stable state of BSMN. Based on the analysis of the evolutionarily stable state, an incentive model with three strategies to encourage different enterprise nodes to participate in “accounting” operations was determined, and smart contracts of the incentive models were developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed incentive models was verified by simulation experiments.}

abstract = {In the machine learning, data sharing between different participants can increase the amount of data, improve the quality of the dataset, and thereby improve the quality of the model. Under the condition of data supervision, federated learning, as a distributed machine learning, aims to protect data while training models through collaboration among all parties to achieve data sharing and improve model quality. However, there are still some issues. For instance, the lack of trust between the participants makes it impossible to establish a secure and reliable sharing mechanism. In addition, how to fairly share the benefits generated by the model, identify honest participants and punish malicious participants is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new federated learning scheme based on blockchain architecture for federated learning data sharing. Moreover, an incentive mechanism based on reputation points and Shaply values is proposed to improve the sustainability of the federated learning system, which provides a credible participation mechanism for data sharing based on federated learning and fair incentives. The experimental results and analysis show that the loss of federated learning is more smooth than that of centralized machine learning.}

The innovative introduction of ecological concepts into the existing ecosystem can ensure the sustainable development and progress of society. This paper mainly studies the path analysis of green technology innovation based on blockchain algorithm. Aiming at the high latency and low efficiency of pbft algorithm in green technology innovation, a low latency consensus algorithm ipbft based on an alternative voting mechanism is proposed. Explore the influencing factors of domestic realization of green technology innovation, clarify the reasons that hinder green technology innovation and give reasonable strategies to help domestic green technology innovation work to be carried out faster and better. This article compares the ipbft algorithm with the improved consensus algorithms cpbft, vpbft and pbft in recent years. Experimental results show that the consensus delay of the ipbft algorithm is much lower than that of the other three algorithms, and the average delay of the ipbft single consensus is only about 370ms. In different transaction volume and different node number throughput performance tests, the ipbft throughput in these two tests is better than the other three algorithms. In the view switching phase, the ipbft algorithm also takes less time than the other three algorithms. The above results show that the ipbft algorithm has lower consensus delay and higher throughput, which can reduce network communication overhead and save system transmission energy consumption. It can ensure the security and authenticity of information in the green technology innovation based on blockchain, and reduce system overhead.}

abstract = {Traceability has emerged as a prime requirement for a multi-tier and multi-site production. It enables visibility and caters to the consumer requirements of transparency and quality assurance. Textile and clothing industry is one such example that requires traceability implementation to address prevailing problems of information asymmetry and low visibility. Customers find it difficult to access product data that can facilitate ethical buying practices or assure product authenticity. Besides, it is challenging for stakeholders to share crucial information in an insecure environment with risk of data manipulations and fear of losing information advantage. In this context, this study investigates and proposes a blockchain-based traceability framework for traceability in multi-tier textile and clothing supply chain. It conceptualizes the interaction of supply chain partners, and related network architecture at the organizational level and smart contract and transaction validation rules at the operational level. To illustrate the application of the proposed framework, the study presents an example of organic cotton supply chain using blockchain with customized smart contract and transaction rules. It finally demonstrates the applicability of the developed blockchain by testing it under two parameters. The proposed system can build a technology-based trust among the supply chain partners, where the distributed ledger can be used to store and authenticate supply chain transactions. Further, the blockchain-based traceability system would provide a unique opportunity, flexibility, and authority to all partners to trace-back their supply network and create transparent and sustainable supply chain.}

Empirical data from 194 SMEs were investigated and ranked using a nonlinear non-compensatory PLS-ANN approach. Competitive pressure, complexity, cost and relative have significant effects on behavioural intention. Market dynamics, regulatory support and upper management support were insignificant predictors. SMEs often lack resources for technological investments but faces same requirements for streamlining business processes to optimise returns and blockchain presents a viable option for SMEs’ sustainability due to its features of immutability, transparency and security that have the potential to revolutionise businesses.

In this study, a framework of environmental smart reporting system (BI-ESRS) based on the blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is developed to automate the acquisition of environment-related data and make the reporting reliable and traceable. In addition, we evaluate the authenticity of the data collected from IoT devices, considering human-made counterfeits on measuring instruments for greenwashing. It is anticipated to stimulate companies to submit high-quality data without fake. Specifically, an unsupervised neural network-enabled spatial-temporal analytics (UN-STA) method is devised to achieve anomalies detection and index the data with an authenticity rate. An artificial neural network, self-organizing map (SOM), is applied to construct the prediction model. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of Bluetooth low energy (BLE), the vibration amplitude of smart instruments and data uploading interval constitute the input vector for competitive learning. Finally, an experimental simulation is carried out to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed system and method, and their effectiveness has also been testified. Moreover, the sensitivity of the SOM model over the three factors has been analyzed by applying the control variate technique.

Traditional mobile number portability system (TMNPS) is based on the manual process, in which existing service provider and the new service provider have to undergo certain transfers once a porting request is generated by the user. Slow processing of request, lack of transparency among the entities involved, and delay during the verification are the major challenges in the TMNPS. Moreover, a third-party is required to ensure the security of the stored and regulated data. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based mobile number portability scheme, which uses an Ethereum blockchain technology and call routing mechanism to handle the request of the user. The secured royalty contract transactions and secure call routing mechanism are the potential part of the proposed scheme. We then evaluated the performance of the proposed scheme and functionalities of the proposed smart contracts (SCs) using experimental setup with respect to various parameters. Results show that the transition time taken by the proposed scheme is only 4 seconds for 200 blocks and TMNPS took 6 seconds to execute the 200 blocks.}

The purpose of this paper is to critically review the current state of the art in digitalizing animal agriculture with Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies, specifically biometric sensors, big data, and blockchain technology. Biometric sensors include either noninvasive or invasive sensors that monitor an individual animal’s health and behavior in real time, allowing farmers to integrate this data for population-level analyses. Real-time information from biometric sensors is processed and integrated using big data analytics systems that rely on statistical algorithms to sort through large, complex data sets to provide farmers with relevant trending patterns and decision-making tools. Sensors enabled blockchain technology affords secure and guaranteed traceability of animal products from farm to table, a key advantage in monitoring disease outbreaks and preventing related economic losses and food-related health pandemics. Thanks to PLF technologies, livestock agriculture has the potential to address the abovementioned pressing concerns by becoming more transparent and fostering increased consumer trust. However, new PLF technologies are still evolving and core component technologies (such as blockchain) are still in their infancy and insufficiently validated at scale. The next generation of PLF technologies calls for preventive and predictive analytics platforms that can sort through massive amounts of data while accounting for specific variables accurately and accessibly. Issues with data privacy, security, and integration need to be addressed before the deployment of multi-farm shared PLF solutions becomes commercially feasible.}

From that perspective, Smart Grids are a mixture of physical actuators, sensors, physical communication networks; and cyber computational and communication protocols and algorithms. In our work, we propose to extend the applicability of decentralized blockchain consensus protocols to the broad field of Cyber–Physical systems. Our contribution includes a proposal of a new family of cyber–physical systems, an in-depth discussion of new possibilities and inherent shortcomings. The proposed coupling of the data storage mechanisms, communication and consensus protocols, allows for deployment of self-sustaining cyber–physical environments in which all the mission-critical aspects in both the cyber and physical layer are effectively incentivized, coordinated and maintained. This includes the essential data storage, data exchange, but also the production, transmission and distribution of energy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first such a comprehensive undertaking toward symbiotic cyber–physical systems and environments. The proposed family of systems is decentralized and does not imply the necessity of reliance on trusted third parties. We propose and discuss an architecture which incorporates physical, blockchain-enabled sensors and actuators capable of monitoring and altering parameters of the underlying physical layer. We analyze a particular instance of a blockchain-aided CPS’, where we are concerned with the power grid at both the micro and macro-grid level. At the macro-grid level we explore the possibility of utilizing blockchain-enabled physical actuators. These theoretical actuators are able to introduce savings by a near real-time routing of energy and enable for tracking of power losses thanks to decentralized accountability. At the micro-grid level we propose a network of blockchain-enabled smart meters to coordinate real-time auction-based energy trade. To glue together the elements of such an open, trustless, decentralized system, we discuss an intrinsic communication protocol capable of rewarding intermediaries of a data exchange for each transmitted byte. We tackle the feasibility, security and accountability challenges which we have faced and which will need to be considered by future architects of the new, exciting family of cyber–physical systems.}

abstract = {Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies has received a substantial interest in the last decade as Blockchain can ensure trust among users without relying on third parties. However, cryptocurrency adoption for micro-payments has been limited due to slow confirmation of transactions and unforeseeable high fees, especially in the case of Bitcoin. To this end, creating off-chain payment channels between users is proposed which enables instant and nearly free transactions without writing to blockchain. Off-chain channel idea is then extended to establish payment channel networks to scale the idea to allow payment routing among many users. However, due to the way these channels are designed, both sides of a channel have a fixed one-way capacity for making transactions. Consequently, if one side consumes the whole one-way capacity, the channel becomes non-transitive in that particular direction, which causes failures of payments that would like to pass through. Eventually, the network becomes partitioned with unevenly distributed funds. In this paper, we propose the adoption of three specific techniques that aim to increase the overall success rate of payments and address channel imbalance problem to keep the payment channel network sustainable in the long run. First, we show the effectiveness of balance-aware routing that better utilizes available funds in the channels. Second, we propose an efficient method for selection of the gateway (i.e., connection point) for a user by considering the gateway’s inbound and outbound capacity. It exploits the fact that end-users can connect the network through multiple gateways any of which can be used to initiate the payment. Finally, we propose proportional payment splitting method to further increase success rate especially for large transactions. We implemented the three approaches for assessing their effectiveness. Compared to existing approaches such as maximum flow or greedy, the proposed approaches can achieve much higher success rates with channels balanced better.}

Many electricity suppliers are engaged in efforts to monetize this transition with ‘green’ services and products, such as Green Electricity Tariffs. These promise customers that their supply includes a specific share of green electricity, yet since electricity suppliers often fail to deliver on those promises, many customers have lost trust in their suppliers. Further information asymmetries may not only exacerbate this loss of trust, but also spark distrust and lead to an overall feeling of ambivalence. Eventually, ambivalent customers may feel inclined to switch suppliers. To prevent this domino effect, electricity suppliers must eliminate ambivalence by increasing customer trust and reducing customer distrust. Here, we discuss how these challenges can be met with a customer loyalty program built on blockchain technology. We developed the program following a Design Science Research approach that facilitated refinement in four iteration and evaluation cycles. Our results indicate that the developed customer loyalty program restores trust, reduces distrust, and resolves customer ambivalence by providing four features: improved customer agency, sufficient and verifiable information, appropriate levels of usability, and unobstructed data access.}

The conventional healthcare system is slowly cruising towards the modern healthcare domain for the ease of process by the users and for adopting rapid sharing and accessing of healthcare data by the authorized users. Cloud computing offers a major role in modernizing the conventional healthcare system as the patient’s sensitive data were shared and stored in the cloud resources so that to access across the world.

Then we proposed the investment decision condition, cost-sharing and profit-sharing contract to achieve coordination, then validated conclusions via numerical simulation. Findings: When the producer’s attention to consumer value increases, under decentralized decision-making, optimal sales price and service level decrease, the producer’s optimal profit increases, while the e-commerce platform’s optimal profit will first increase, then decrease; under centralized decision-making, optimal sales price decreases, and optimal service level and overall optimal profit increase. Under decentralized decision-making, in the traditional e-commerce supply chain, optimal decisions and profits first increase, then decrease with increased misrepresentation in favorable product ratings; in the BOCR technology e-commerce supply chain, members can optimize costs and increase profits by extracting more valuable information. The optimal sales price and service level show different size relationships with production cost changes. When investment costs meet specific conditions, using BOCR technology can make members more profitable. The cost-sharing and profit-sharing contract enables e-commerce coordination.}

abstract = {Shared Manufacturing (SharedMfg), a Peer-to-Peer (P2P)-based resource sharing paradigm boosted by the wide-spread of sharing economy, servitization and Internet of things, tends to massively extend the scope of resource sharing in both vertical and horizontal directions, and as a consequence, it amplifies a credibility gap in the manufacturing area. To respond to this problem, and meanwhile, promoting the SharedMfg, blockchain is attempted to integrate into the SharedMfg. Hence, this paper proposes the Blockchain-based SharedMfg (BSM) framework in support of the application of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). At the same time, Resource Operation Blockchain (ROB) is constructed for the core operation of BSM framework, which carries out on the basis of a consensus mechanism (i.e., Proof-of-Participation) and a Smart Contract Network (SCN), to facilitate the P2P-based resource sharing paradigm. A prototype system is implemented by the Ethereum framework together with discussions to validate the feasibility of ROB. In brief, BSM framework complementarily combines the blockchain and SharedMfg, beneficial to promote both modes.}

Organizations and experts have rallied around it, all the more since the attack against the agreement by the current US administration. This rally has led to a collective unwillingness to acknowledge what the evidence already tells us: the Paris Agreement and the currently dominant, international approach to climate change policy will not work. Much faster and more decisive change is needed; a paradigm shift. We need a policy which provides for a realistic yet rapid transition from our dependence on cheap fossil fuels to deep decarbonization and a sustained reliance on renewable sources of energy. We argue in this paper that, thanks to advances in Information Technology (IT) and social media, viable options exist for an alternative global, transnational climate policy. Three key principles have to be followed: (i) gradual expansion across boundaries; (ii) use of economic incentives to compel behavioral change; and (iii) a close link between the price of carbon and the use of raised funds. The funds from the climate risk surcharge collected on fossil fuels at the source, a central piece of the proposal, are to be used for subsidizing adaption to and insurance against damage from climate change. The paper argues that the challenges in terms of information requirements and institutional resistance can be overcome if IT solutions are deployed within a public-private governance framework that protects the public interest.}

However, in the process of monitoring, how to store the monitoring data safely and reliably has become a research problem. Therefore, this paper proposes a storage method of agricultural monitoring data based on Sustainable blockchain technology. Among them, this paper mainly studies the monitoring data storage and privacy protection scheme. With the continuous storage of monitoring data, the amount of data is increasing, which leads to the shortage of local storage space. Therefore, in the improvement of the existing local storage space storage method, with the advantages of cloud storage, the data is encrypted and stored in the cloud, and the privacy side based on blockchain is adopted It can ensure the privacy and security of storage. In the simulation analysis, it is found that the data storage method designed in this paper can store more than 0.5 mb/s for three groups of data with the size of 0 MB, 100 MB and 200 MB. Considering the privacy protection scheme of the storage system, the 1024 bit key is adopted, which can ensure the security of agricultural monitoring data stored in the cloud.}

The proposed solutions to overcome these challenges should not only consider the way the food is produced but also take care of societal, environmental and economic concerns. There has been increasing use of emerging technologies in the agriculture supply chains. The internet of things, the blockchain, and big data technologies are potential enablers of sustainable agriculture supply chains. These technologies are driving the agricultural supply chain towards a digital supply chain environment that is data-driven. Realizing the significance of a data-driven sustainable agriculture supply chain we extracted and reviewed 84 academic journals from 2000 to 2017. The primary purpose of the review was to understand the level of analytics used (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive), sustainable agriculture supply chain objectives attained (social, environmental and economic), the supply chain processes from where the data is collected, and the supply chain resources deployed for the same. Based on the results of the review, we propose an application framework for the practitioners involved in the agri-food supply chain that identifies the supply chain visibility and supply chain resources as the main driving force for developing data analytics capability and achieving the sustainable performance. The framework will guide the practitioners to plan their investments to build a robust data-driven agri-food supply chain. Finally, we outline the future research directions and limitations of our study.}

abstract = {Variable renewable energy sources are continuously increasing their share in the world energy mix. However, their uncertainty has a deep impact in the electric grid safe operation. One of the most promising solutions to tackle such challenge at a distribution grid level consists of quasi-real-time, peer-to-peer electricity markets. These can use the blockchain to be successfully implemented in a secure and privacy preserving way, making effective use of the increasing intelligence of Internet of Things appliances. Nevertheless, providing blockchain-based solutions compatible with the energy sector is not an easy task. In particular, in order to be compliant with typical electricity costs of the order of some €cents/kWh, blockchain transactions are required to be very cheap. Unfortunately, none of the existing research works took the issue of transaction costs into account. As a result, real-world feasibility of existing solutions is rather to be investigated. In this work, we propose an ad-hoc Ethereum-based consortium blockchain explicitly addressing this issue. Leveraging on this platform, we design a blockchain-based electricity market. The market consists of two-steps. The first (day-ahead) step settles the amounts and prices of the energy traded among peers. The second step is instead quasi-real-time, thus enabling the unexpected excess or lack of electricity to be directly negotiated on a peer-to-peer basis. Negotiations occurs without the need of any intermediary, except for the check of grid physical limits, performed by the distribution system operator. To demonstrate the functionality of the solution, a proof-of-concept has been implemented at the University of Pisa (Italy).}

Physical and information flows in energy systems are increasingly complex and distributed, leaving centralized structures inefficient. Blockchain technology is suggested as part of the next step in this transition. Blockchain has potential to facilitate distributed, peer-to-peer trading with reduced transaction costs, increased security via cryptography, and prosumer choice. However, there are as of yet multiple challenges to the expansion of blockchain in the energy sector. This paper argues that analysis of these challenges requires a multi-angled approach incorporating technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions. First, each dimension is explored, substantiated based on a blockchain-based energy system case in Japan. Concrete challenges of scaling this case toward 2050 and potential opportunities in overcoming these challenges are discussed, leveraging extensive literature review. Finally, an overview of strategic indications is suggested. The findings of this paper present initial indications on challenges and opportunities to overcome them based on a multi-dimensional overview. It is suggested that the factors identified across the dimensions are interrelated. This would in turn call for coherent innovation management and multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystems. Living Labs and regulatory sandboxes are prospective foundations to support such ecosystems, and enable informed decision-making among both private and public sector actors. At large, it is suggested that a holistic and pragmatic approach can benefit the application and scalability of blockchain in the energy transition.}

Studies are being conducted worldwide to leverage the benefits provided by BT in improving the performance of the supply chains. The literature reveals BT to offer various benefits leading to improvements in the sustainable performance of the agriculture supply chains (ASC). It is expected that BT will bring a paradigm shift in the way the transactions are carried in the ASC by reducing the high number of intermediaries, delayed payments and high transaction lead times. India, a developing economy, caters to the food security needs of an ever-growing population and faces many challenges affecting ASC sustainability. It is therefore essential to adopt BT in the ASC to leverage the various benefits. In this study, we identify and establish the relationships between the enablers of BT adoption in ASC. Thirteen enablers were identified from the literature and validated by the experts before applying a combined Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology to envision the complex causal relationships between the identified BT enablers. The findings from the study suggest that, among the identified enablers, traceability was the most significant reason for BT implementation in ASC followed by auditability, immutability, and provenance. The findings of the study will help the practitioners to design the strategies for BT implementation in agriculture, creating a real-time data-driven ASC. The results will also help the policymakers in developing policies for faster implementation of BT ensuring food safety and sustainable ASCs.}

Transactions in the bitcoin system are stored in a public transaction ledger (‘the blockchain’), which is stored in a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Bitcoin provides decentralized currency issuance and transaction clearance. The security of the blockchain depends on a compute-intensive algorithm for bitcoin mining, which prevents double spending of bitcoins and tampering with confirmed transactions. This ‘proof-of-work’ algorithm is energy demanding. How much energy is actually consumed, is subject of debate. We argue that this energy consumption currently is in the range of 100–500MW. We discuss the developments in bitcoin mining hardware. We also briefly outline alternative schemes that are less energy demanding. We finally look at other blockchain applications, and argue that also here energy consumption is not of primary concern.}

Thus its capabilities make it suitable as the technology for energy management in islanded microgrids (MGs) based on automatic micropayments between the entities of the system. In this chapter a multiagent market framework is proposed for islanded blockchain-based MGs as sustainable energy systems. The proposed multiagent system (MAS) consists of three types of agents: producers, consumers, and the so-called prosumers (which are able to produce and consume energy). In this way, each agent writes the required energy demand or energy generation capacity into their corresponding blockchain accounts. Oracle agents are in charge of providing information about the energy offers in the blockchain-based MG. If there is an unbalance in the MG, the surplus/demand energy is transacted with an MG operator agent, to trade energy with the upstream grid. In the proposed blockchain-based MG, the agents are connected to a permissioned blockchain. This kind of blockchain has a scalable design and handles a high rate of transactions per second with low fees. Although this type of blockchain has its downsides, like it is not fully decentralized, it is suitable for performing micropayments and securing the system.}

The main findings are: (1) ICT technique adoption is affected by application design and socio-demographic factors, while research in BTs in this area only focuses on application design factors; (2) ICTs and BTs have similar applications in agricultural production (information provision for efficient decisions and production improvement), logistics (tracing), and supply chain (trust-building); (3) ICT techniques are applied more to production improvement, while BTs focus more on using visibility, traceability, and automation to improve transparency and transaction efficiency in whole sectors; (4) in relation to consumption, ICTs focus on balancing supply and demand to achieve market stability, while BTs investigate effects on consumer purchasing decisions. Insights are also proposed for future research based on common challenges in the application of ICT and blockchain in agriculture in the following areas: (i) security and privacy protection; (ii) solutions for scalability and interoperability; (iii) solutions for high cost and high consumption, and demands for high knowledge in technology application; (iv) formulation of policies and regulations related to standard criteria for market stability.

Smart Green cities are the future technology that emphasizes the impending of digital arrangement to enhance green environments and simplifies the authorization in green space planning. As the devices which are used in smart city applications are entirely equipped with the Internet of Things (IoT), there comes the need for ensuring the sustainability of such devices. Blockchain-based energy management is the most sensational issue that drives the implementation of smart green cities. For real-time IoT applications, there exists a demand for sensitivity and latency. Edge computing can provide support to deal with these kinds of issues, by providing a most well-organized structure in reducing the delays and thus improves the performance of the system. This chapter deals with the applications of blockchain and its technologies with the development of the energy-efficient smart green city in IoT environments. A novel model for the management of energy, waste, soil, and air is proposed by using the integrated blockchain technologies. The blockchain method will deliver a safety base for data regulation, and also the transaction of information is in between the unconventionally working devices in the edge-based smart green city environments. This will create a sustainable environment with more security features. The proper handoff mechanism with appropriate authentication routing strategy is proposed in this chapter. This will provide security against all kinds of suspicious attacks and thus improves the performance of the network and reduces the response time. Thus, the proposed sensor-based resource management with edge computing through SDN and blockchain paves the way for security and reliability in a smart city, making human life more comfortable and innocuous.}

This has led to various attempts to apply blockchain technology (BCT) to the food cold chain, such as IBM's FoodTrust and Alibaba's Food Trust Frameworks. This system is expected to guarantee food traceability and sustainability. In this research, we focused on the importance of maritime and aviation transportation in the entire supply chain, and we established the BCT-based beef cold chain system, which includes the reefer chain. Specifically, we raised the monitoring and physical infrastructure issues at the port (or airport) and maritime (aviation) transportation node and took these into consideration. Additionally, we conducted scenario analysis to investigate the effects of the suggested system. The amount of food losses and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated by different scenarios in accordance with the recall recovery time and node where a recall occurrence is recognized. For both import and export models, when the proposed BCT-based beef cold chain platform is applied, the number of discarded reefer containers and the associated GHG emissions go down by 42.1\% and 21.8\%, respectively. Interestingly, when we assumed the recall recognition stage was right after the defects occur, the largest effects of improving performance of the proposed platform were 48.3\% in import (IM) node of the port level. These results will provide a needed solution for cold chain management at the government level and affirms the essential role of the port/airport in the cold chain.}

This review provides a detailed insight into the full potential in 6G for the acceleration of RES with the faster and stable data bandwidth. The potential applications of 6G wireless networks for faster data processing in RES include P2P energy trade market, vehicular network, wireless energy transfer, energy management system, smart grid, self-healing, smart batteries and AI-based weather forecasting. This paper also lists the advantages and challenges of 6G in RES sectors, the practical implementations and the potential applications. It was found out that although the 6G is a visionary application in the RES sector to improve the security, connectivity, integration and sensory data processing of RES, 6G still possesses various technical limitations, including incompatibility issues of older devices, higher power consumption and higher operating cost. Future research should focus on the improvements of 6G in RES in terms of cost-effectiveness, compatibility issues and power consumption to balance between the advancement and limitations. This review serves as a visionary for 6G wireless communication to be applied in the RES sector in the near future. 6G in the RES sector encountered several critical limitations needing an intensive development, including still the issues of security and privacy, prone to hacking or data bleaching, required advanced hardware support and requirements for ultra-fast communications with low latency.}

abstract = {Ensuring social security through the defense organization determines the creation of links between the army and society. Realizing the benefits of the Internet of Battle Things in the defense system can perfectly monetize intelligence and strengthen the armed forces. It establishes a network for strong connectivity in the army with good coordination between complex processes to effectively edge out the enemies. However, this new technology poses organizational and national security challenges that present both opportunities and obstacles. The current framework of the defense IoT network for sustainable society is not adequate enough to make actionable situational awareness decisions in order to infer the state of the battlefield while preserving the privacy of sensitive data. In this paper, we propose a distributed computing defence framework for sustainable society using the features of blockchain technology and federated learning. The proposed model presents an algorithm to meet the challenges of limited training data in order to obtain high accuracy and avoid a reason specific model. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we prepare the dataset and investigate the performance of our framework in various scenarios. The result outcomes are promising in terms of accuracy and loss compared to baseline approach.}

The participants are called miners and the ones who successfully add a block to the network are rewarded. As technology evolves over the years, the “mining” process has become more challenging, with miners facing longer periods of negative cash flow while still having expenses. This business architecture has driven away participants, jeopardizing its operation and hindering its progression. To solve this problem, an alternative to provide financial sustainability for miners is to join a mining pool whose main objective is to mitigate cash flow shortages by sharing the rewards obtained by the group, which in turn will be more constant. In this work, we propose a reward sharing methodology for mining pools based on the least-core of a stochastic cooperative game. A risk-averse value functional based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is used to characterize the game’s certainty equivalent. Two numerical experiments were conducted in this work: (i) one based on a small, illustrative network; and (ii) one derived from real data of the Bitcoin-refunded Blockchain network. The focus of the experiment is on the incremental value of the proposed methodology over using intuitive allocations (uniform and based on computational power) and to what extent the relative increase in the chance of mining by participating as group benefits the stability of the pool. Finally, we deliberate and numerically analyze a nested procedure derived from the proposed least-core-based allocation seeking increased “fairness” in sharing the pool rewards.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a secure blockchain based energy trading system for residential homes. In the system, a new proof-of-computational closeness (PoCC) consensus protocol is proposed for the selection of miners and the creation of blocks. Moreover, an analytical energy pricing policy is designed to solve the problem of existing energy pricing policies in a distributed trading environment. A dynamic multi-pseudonym mechanism is developed for the prosumers to preserve their transactional privacy during energy trading. Since it requires extra storage and computing resources for the blockchain miners to simultaneously execute both mining process and application intensive tasks, therefore, an improved sparse neural network (ISNN) is proposed for computation offloading to the cloud servers. In ISNN, a Jaya optimization algorithm is used to accelerate the error convergence rate while reducing the number of connections between different layers of neurons. Besides, ISNN optimizes the overall computational cost of the system. Furthermore, the security of the prosumers is ensured using blockchain technology while security analysis shows that the system is robust against the Sybil attack. The proposed blockchain based peer-to-peer secure energy trading system is extremely important for sustainable cities and society. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed pricing policy is compared with time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing policies. From the results, it is proved that the prosumers achieve a higher degree of satisfaction and utility when using the proposed pricing policy. Moreover, the probability of a successful Sybil attack is zero as the number of attackers’ identities and computational capacities increases. Under different sizes of data to be uploaded, the proposed ISNN scheme has the least average computational cost and data transmission time as compared to deep reinforcement learning combined with genetic algorithm (DRGO) and sparse evolutionary training and multi-layer perceptron (SET-MLP) schemes in the literature. Moreover, the proposed system is tested for scalability by increasing the number of prosumers. Extensive simulations are performed and the results depict the satisfactory performance of the proposed system.}

In doing so, the paper considers the technical and political challenges of building trust and equity for various stakeholders. A blockchain is a smart electronic database, distributed to all users, immutably tracking every transaction that has ever taken place on the network. The blockchain is very difficult to hack, with no single point of authority to make mistakes and collapse the system. Automated consensus protocols enable data transmitted on the network to be verified and stored immutably, minimising the risk of data corruption to near-zero. Blockchain is being increasingly hyped for a range of services and industries, including transparent resourcing for marine conservation, reducing pollution from plastics, reducing slavery at sea, and sustainable fisheries management. Public distrust in some conservation operations, as well as in the provenance of seafood, is growing. Although some global marine conservation organisations and seafood producers have found practical solutions in disruptive technologies like blockchain, riding this wave will only prove worthwhile if coastal communities and artisanal fishers are on board and stand a chance of landing a fair share of the benefits.}

This paper is an attempt to study the use of BC technology and a try to develop efficient sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) rather than the inefficient design of supply chain management (SCM). Important variables related to BC are identified from the literature after going through discussion with academician and industry experts. These variables are further analyzed and modeled using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fuzzy-Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). PCA is applied to form the principal factor from these identified variables based on possible correlation. Although, the application of Fuzzy-DEMATEL is adopted to identify major causes that help to achieve sustainable supply chain (SSC) after integration of BC technology. The proposed integrated (incorporated) approach of PCA and Fuzzy-DEMATEL found six major causes namely Data safety and Decentralization, Accessibility, Laws and Policy, Documentation, Data management, and Quality. This study is revolving around the integrated approach of two streams namely BC-related Information technology and SC from Operations. This research represents the significant role of causes, which leads to the integration of BC with the SC resulting in achieving sustainability. BC technology is still in their nuance stage and this study will motivate researcher and industrial practitioners to achieve a more efficient and effective goal in SC practices to achieve sustainability.}

abstract = {Rationale
Cheese whey has relevant nutritional, health and functional properties that could address the dietary needs of a growing world population. Nevertheless, around 50\% of whey produced globally is not reused in the food system. A significant role in cheese production is played by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that process typical products labelled with a protected designation of origin (PDO), representing both the cultural heritage and the major economical resource of specific geographical regions.
Scope and approach
This study is aimed at identifying the potential involvement of SMEs in the recycling of whey for food uses. Techno-economic analyses of whey recycling processes were reviewed to define efficient configurations and plant size. Safety and quality specifications for whey were then examined as well as traceability systems designed for improving transparency among the actors and stakeholders of the dairy supply chain.
Key findings and conclusion
The study led to conclude that a whey value chain could be built by various cheese SMEs and a stand-alone industrial unit for the downstream processing of whey into value-added foods. In this scenario, advantages could derive from the involvement of SMEs that belong to the same PDO cheese consortium, in terms of standardization of whey, third party certification and possible use of smart traceability tools. Hence, the SMEs producing PDO products could advance the application of the bioeconomy principles in the food system. Research challenges to promote the implementation of the conceived whey value chain are finally outlined.}

However, given substantial knowledge gaps in bud dormancy mechanisms, accurate models are still a long way off. This research documented the change in polyamines (PAs) associated with seasonal bud dormancy in early flowering almond (Prunus amygdalus L.) cv. ʻMohebʼ and late flowering cv. ʻRabiʼ. The objective was to evaluate the change and possible role of PAs during the endodormancy transition phase. The results show that chilling accumulation was first accompanied with a rise in putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd), and spermine (Spm) concentrations. Therefore, low Put, Spd, and Spm levels, at the starting date of experiment, before receiving any natural chilling, may be associated with the imposition of bud dormancy. Regardless of cultivar, Spm was the most abundant free PA with a range of 11.3–19.0 nmol g−1 F.w. for ʻMohebʼ and 22.1–29.7 nmol g−1 F.w. for ʻRabiʼ. The continuously increases in Spm indicates that it may play an important played role in cold tolerance and flower bud development processes. Diamine oxidase (DAO) activity significantly decreased from December 2nd to February 24th (post-dormant” stage) from 2.3 to 1.0 in ʻMohebʼ and from 1.8 to 0.7 U g−1 F.w. min−1 in ʻRabiʼ. Polyamine oxidase (PAO) activity showed a similar pattern, but the values of PAO activity were higher than the ones obtained for DAO activity. At the late stages, there was an inconsistent trend in differences in almond bud Put, Spd, and Spm among cultivars. Genotypic differences affecting the bloom time could account for the observed differences in the polyamine levels of the cultivars.}

The goal of this research is to present a comprehensive review of blockchain adoption barriers in the context of humanitarian supply chain management. An integrated approach using Fuzzy Delphi and Best-Worst method (BWM) has been used for analyzing the barriers. Based on the literature, 14 barriers of the blockchain adoption in humanitarian supply chain were identified. According to the Fuzzy Delphi result, 9 barriers were accepted. After that, the BWM calculated the importance of each barrier. The findings showed that regulatory uncertainty, lack of knowledge/employee training and high sustainability costs are the important barriers.

The article mobilizes concepts from political geography and political ecology to argue that digital technologies of traceability in extractive processes potentially create new forms of control and exclusion or exacerbate existing social, political, and territorial dispossession through asymmetric relations of power and knowledge in mineral supply chains. Despite industry efforts to make mineral supply chains more sustainable by resorting to digital certification and traceability, the strategic uses of uncertainty, ignorance, and ambiguity undergirding blockchain-enabled traceability systems fail to challenge existing inequalities in resource use and access or fulfill the promise of transparency and accountability.}

Considering this cross-channel effect and sustainable digital agricultural (e-agriculture) development, this study constructed a theoretical analysis model to investigate the impact of the ICT- and BT-driven agricultural cross-channel information strategy on the retailer pricing strategy and customer behavior. The results indicate that, although ICT and BT tools provide agricultural retailers and customers with more information, a cross-channel information strategy does not continuously increase retailers’ sales performance. Retailers tend to leverage this strategy when the devaluation coefficient (customers’ quality perception for a product) is low. This channel information strategy is influenced by the offline channel cost and the devaluation coefficient in online trading. These findings on the devaluation effect can guide retailers in their channel information and pricing strategies and marketing-related decisions.}

This paper investigates the state of the art in the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in maternal healthcare: how they are transforming methods of treatment, diagnosis and monitoring of pregnancy, and how they are reorganizing the management and organization of healthcare systems. A systematic literature review was carried out with 43 papers that met specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. It was found that most of the research focus is on the provision of solutions for low- to medium-income countries that are still lagging behind in reducing maternal and child mortality rates even though there has been an advancement in terms of Industry 4.0 technology use. The research was largely quantitative in nature with models and frameworks developed as opposed to prototypes. It mainly combined the Internet of things (IoT) with Cloud computing and Big data analytics (BDA). Artificial intelligence (AI) in maternal healthcare was similarly trending. Only one paper focused on the use of blockchain in facilitating health information exchange of maternal records. Recommendations for policy and a future research agenda are made.}

abstract = {With the sustainable development of cities, green transportation is regarded as a critical approach to mitigate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Driven by this, Electric vehicles (EV) have been strongly advocated by the government for their zero-emission merit. However, the promotion of EV is not smoothly caused by inconvenient charging issues. For the high construction cost and land scarcity, current public charging stations could not meet the booming charging demands and worry the potential EV users. To address the problem, this paper proposed a peer-to-peer (P2P) private charging pile sharing system supported by blockchain technology. In this system, the charging records of EV users could be packaged and uploaded into the blockchain, which is immutable and tamper-resistant. The detailed blockchain hierarchy is also designed to make this system more practical. Meanwhile, the Multi-Agent-Based (MAB) model is adopted to evaluate the performance of this sharing system.

Furthermore, several numerical experiments are conducted to unveil the inner business relationships between charing demanders and pile suppliers. Lastly, the proposed private pile sharing system is validated by the realistic data of the Lujiazui business circle in Shanghai, China.}

abstract = {Bitcoin and other similar digital currencies on blockchains are not ideal means for payment, because their prices tend to go up in the long term (thus people are incentivized to hoard those currencies), and to fluctuate widely in the short term (thus people would want to avoid risks of losing values). The reason why those blockchain currencies based on proof of work are unstable may be found in their designs that the supplies of currencies do not respond to their positive and negative demand shocks, as the authors have formulated in our past work. Continuing from our past work, this paper proposes minimal changes to the design of blockchain currencies so that their market prices are automatically stabilized, absorbing both positive and negative demand shocks of the currencies by autonomously controlling their supplies. Those changes are: 1) limiting re-adjustment of proof-of-work targets, 2) making mining rewards variable according to the observed over-threshold changes of block intervals, and 3) enforcing negative interests to remove old coins in circulation. We have made basic design checks and evaluations of these measures through simple simulations. In addition to stabilization of prices, the proposed measures may have effects of making those currencies preferred means for payment by disincentivizing hoarding, and improving sustainability of the currency systems by making rewards to miners perpetual.}

The methodological approach is based on basic informatics principles like the Turing machine and ontologies.}

The study aims to reveal the synthesis between AI and GB, as well as to highlight research trends along with knowledge gaps that may be tackled in future AI-in-GB research. A quantitative bibliometric analysis was conducted to objectively identify the major research hotspots, trends, knowledge gaps and future research needs based on 383 research publications identified from Scopus. A further qualitative systematic analysis was also conducted on 76 screened research publications on AI-in-GB. Through this mixed-methods systematic review, knowledge gaps were identified, and future research directions of AI-in-GB were proposed as follows: digital twins and AI of things; blockchain; robotics and 4D printing; and legal, ethical, and moral responsibilities of AI-in-GB. This study adds to the GB knowledge domain by synthesizing the state-of-the-art of AI-in-GB and revealing the research needs in this field to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the AEC sector.}

The quality of IoT networks heavily relies on the involvement of devices for undertaking functions from data sensing, computation to communication and IoT intelligence. Stimulating IoT devices to actively participate and contribute to the network is a practical challenge, where incentive techniques such as blockchain, game theory, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are highly desirable to build a sustainable IoT ecosystem. In this article, we present a systematic literature review of the incentive techniques for IoT, aiming to provide general readers with an overview of incentive-enabled IoT from background, motivations, and enabling techniques. Particularly, we first present the fundamentals of IoT data network infrastructure, and several key incentive techniques for IoT are described in details, including blockchain, game theory, and AI. We next provide an extensive review on the use of these incentive techniques in a number of key IoT services, such as IoT data sharing, IoT data offloading and caching, IoT mobile crowdsensing, and IoT security and privacy. Subsequently, we explore the potential of incentives in important IoT applications, ranging from smart healthcare, smart transportation to smart city and smart industry. The research challenges of incentive techniques in IoT networks are highlighted, and the potential directions are also pointed out for future research of this important area.}

abstract = {Fish constitute important high protein products to meet the demands of an increasing global population. However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing. Thus, addressing key challenges by way of the global digital transformation of fishery and aquaculture industry will meet several sustainable development goals of the United Nations catered around the application of disruptive technology.}

This chapter uses a number of practical applications and real-world examples to delve into blockchain's roles in contributing to these objectives. A key argument is that blockchain makes it possible to trace ingredients and components across multiple tiers of a supply chain because data must be shared in a tamperproof way and must be accessible to relevant parties. Blockchain, thus, facilitates traceability, which is among the key mechanisms by which blockchain can help firms meet the various supply chain objectives.}

At the same time, scientists and developers are searching for innovative methods to better understand how the fundamental shifts caused by digital change will affect the future of humanity over the coming decades. Interdisciplinary governance research at the intersection of technological and environmental foresight is urgently needed to minimize the risks of technological change and explore how digitalization may support, hinder or re-shape sustainability transformations. In this article, we focus on the case of ‘blockchain’ or distributed-ledger technology (DLT) to investigate how recent digital technologies may support the implementation of sustainable development initiatives. Our investigation is centered on areas of public administration and governance which will most likely see an adoption of DLT over the next two decades, such as digital identity, social service provision, and innovative climate finance. To allow for a meaningful comparison of various use cases, we propose four guiding questions that can help researchers, decision-makers and practitioners to determine whether DLT might be an appropriate choice for the sustainability-related task at hand. Moreover, we illustrate how the initial design and subsequent implementation of DLTs may support more centralized or networked modes of governance.}

Decentralization can be performed by various market schemes based on available infrastructure and technologies in a region. Accordingly, blockchain can better integrate current market players to provide energy balance. Moreover, it can incentivized new players through special smart contracts. For example, electric vehicles (EVs) can be paid for their active role as energy supplier or demand response provider.

We identify these barriers with the help of extant literature and experts’ opinions and further classify them into ten broad categories. Then, we establish the causal relationships among those barriers and rank them based on their degree of prominence and relationships. We find that challenges in scalability and market-based risks are the most influencing barriers. Whereas high sustainability costs and poor economic behavior are the most influenced barriers during successful blockchain adoption. Finally, we perform a series of sensitivity analysis to test the robustness and generalizability of our proposed framework. Findings from our study will be beneficial for managers and help to eliminate the major barriers in the efficient implementation of blockchain technologies in their organizations.}

Repositioning democratic values of citizens’ choices in these complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens’ trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens’ choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated using official accident data from public authorities, which are compared against wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus, self-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented democracy paradigm is outlined.}

This study endeavors to address these problems by introducing an innovative solution based on blockchain technology. We propose establishing a national hybrid blockchain-based platform that brings together all possible stakeholders in the field of higher education, including students, universities, government agencies, policymakers, and companies from the business sector. This study evaluates the costs and benefits from establishing this platform and investigates the possible commercialization of its contracts. Furthermore, we test the feasibility of this platform in two of the most instable low-income countries: Syria and Sudan. We find that this platform is feasible and can serve as a marketplace for all stakeholders in the higher education system and would increase the internationalization of higher education. The establishment of this platform will ensure inclusive and equitable education and promotes lifelong learning opportunities for students from low-income countries and thus meets the fourth goal of Sustainable Development.}

The next generation GW management tools are emerging with web-based GW management platforms following FAIR Data Principles—Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. These web-based platforms can improve participation, cooperation, and collective action, and enable alternative forms of GW management such as commons-based peer management of GW resources. These web-based platforms not only provide comprehensive and timely information about the GW system with simulation and gaming tools, but also enable agents to work cooperatively.

We show how these web-based platforms can provide historical and future-scenario information for strategic planning and development, and real-time information for daily decision-making. These web-based platforms can additionally facilitate cooperation among GW users through a blockchain-based system for GW credit, GW trading, and GW policy incentives, as an example. Furthermore, these we-based platforms do not only inform on GW systems, but also can be useful for other smart technologies such as smart agriculture, and smart city. Insights regarding the prospects of digital GW and the anticipated transformation of GW management practices are important for researchers, GW regulators, GW managers, GW users, and technology providers to plan for tomorrow.}

abstract = {The blockchain is considered to be the potential driver of the digital economy. The Blockchain technology outweighs the challenges associated with the traditional transaction business governed and regulated by the third trusted party. There is a growth in the interest among the researchers, the industry, and the academia to study and leverage the potential of Blockchain. Blockchain provides a decentralized and distributed public ledger for all the participating parties. Though it seems that blockchain is a viable choice and solution for all the centralized governed and regulated transactions (in digital online space), it has potential challenges that need to be resolved; opportunities to be explored, and applications to be studied. This paper utilizes a systematic literature review to study several research endeavors made in the domain of blockchain. To further research on blockchain adoption, the paper theoretically constructs an integrated framework of the blockchain innovation adoption process in an organization considering organizational and user acceptance perspectives. This would facilitate its widespread adoption, thereby achieving sustained leadership solutions. The paper offers 23 propositions to information systems (IS)/information management (IM) scholars with respect to innovation characteristics, organizational characteristics, environmental characteristics, and user acceptance characteristics. Further, the paper explores several areas of future research and directions that can provide deep insights for overcoming challenges and for the adoption of blockchain technology.}

Here, we identify some of the emerging technologies that the international development community needs to consider as it seeks to take advantage of new technologies to promote sustainable development. There are several innovations – such as blockchain, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, cellular agriculture, and gene editing techniques that could either positively or negatively affect the environment, food security, human health, and the transition to clean energy. Some of their benefits and potential environmental and socio-economic concerns are discussed. We further suggest actions that can be taken by organizations involved in sustainable development, such as the United Nations and other global and regional bodies, to exploit the benefits from novel technologies and mitigate their risks.}

The main idea behind making everything smarter is to improve individuals’ quality of life. An excellent example of such a technology is smart healthcare which provides efficient, sustainable, and real-time human services. However, data security and privacy are among the most important challenges of smart healthcare applications. Blockchain (BC) has been considered as a promising solution for the secure management of healthcare data due to its immutability and transparency features. However, there is a trade-off between transparency and user data privacy which is a prominent challenge in adopting BC for healthcare applications. Some researchers have considered user data privacy and proposed a few solutions; however, data owner’s access control desire has not been considered in the state-of-the-art models. In this paper, to overcome the trade-off challenge between transparency and access control, we propose an architecture (so-called BCHealth) that enables data owners to define their desired access policies over their privacy-sensitive healthcare data. BCHealth is composed of two separate chains for storing access policies and data transactions. We address the real-world development challenges of BC, i.e., scalability, delay, and overhead, by adopting a clustering approach. Our extensive experimental analysis proves the efficiency of BCHealth (in terms of computation and processing time) and its resilience against several security attacks.}

Due to rapid population growth, there is an urgent need for devising water saving solutions. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based incentivized edge computing framework for water saving using soft computing methodologies. The framework facilitates decision makers in creating awareness among people about water savings in a easily understandable scientific way. Our incentivized blockchain based model uses edge computing at the house nodes of the network to predict the actual usage of a particular household in the locality based on several factors such as number of people, average income of family, profession of the members and previous water demands. By using Feed Forward Networks and Mixture Density Networks, we predict the water usage in terms of input factors and historical usage respectively, thus incorporating machine computing into the framework. With the two values from these methods, a comparison is made with the actual amount of water used by the householders. This research proposes deployment of the smart contract on the blockchain network for efficient and accurate reward distribution. Incentives and rewards are given in the blockchain network to houses with lesser consumption and penalties are imposed when usage crosses predicted and historic usage. The model ensures that accurate incentives are provided to the people in order to motivate them to avoid wastage of water. Results show that the methods used in our work perform better than other relevant networks on a self-synthesized dataset. The proposed methods converge well and show higher spatio-temporal accuracy.}

Growing concerns over climate change are also driving global cities to decarbonize energy systems using increasingly cheaper renewable energy, in which smart cities play critical roles. Integration of electric vehicles (EVs) with the ICT infrastructure is an emerging issue to not only accommodate growing EV fleets but also for cost-effective deep decarbonization as energy storage. In this chapter, we review rapidly evolving smart cities and its definition, infrastructure, and disruptive blockchain applications for energy and EV integration. Then, we move on to the vehicle to X technology, a critical application for the future urban decarbonization. Finally, we introduce an important digital platform software (IoT platform), FI (Future Internet)-WARE.}

abstract = {One of Bitcoin’s most significant problems is its seemingly insatiable use of electricity. In the present research, along with providing the required power for Bitcoin (BTC) mining, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system fed either by natural gas or biogas as a renewable source of energy is used to supply the electricity demand. Thermodynamic modeling for the fuel cell system is applied to determine the required biogas or natural gas. For the proposed cases (grid-based, natural gas-fed SOFC and biogas fed SOFC), various scenarios depending on the Bitcoin price and mining difficulty are proposed. Also, the economic viability for each scenario in several countries is investigated and compared. Results indicate more profitability for grid-based mining in Bitcoin prices up to \$20,000, but as the Bitcoin price increases SOFC based mining operations achieve reasonable profitability. It is shown that Iran, Russia, and China with cumulative cash flows of \$87,300, \$77,200 and \$70,500 respectively, are the best countries to mine BTC using grid electricity while Iran, Canada and Russia are the best countries using a natural gas-fed SOFC system. While the profitability of SOFC-based mining is lower than grid-based mining, the latter method compensates with better sustainability and lower environmental costs.}

In this paper, we critique ICT's current and projected climate impacts. Peer-reviewed studies estimate ICT's current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.8\%–2.8\% of global GHG emissions; adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we find that this share could actually be between 2.1\% and 3.9\%. For ICT's future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts' projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.}

The non-repudiation and non-tampering features of the block chain are used in this study to provide trust in collaborative edges. To address the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, create a block chain-based huge data sharing architecture in cooperative edges. Then, for high computational reduction, propose a Proof-of-Collaboration consensus technique, in which edge devices participate in block formation by giving their PoC credits. Furthermore, a useless transaction filter technique was proposed for transaction offloading, drastically decreasing the block chain's storage space in edges. Comprehensive tests are carried out to illustrate our proposal's better performance.

FinTech affects consumption, savings, and investment decisions in the renewable energy sector. Examples include cryptocurrencies such as NRGcoin, blockchain-based renewable energy certificates such as Origin from the Energy Web Foundation, and crowdfunding to raise funds for renewable energy projects. This study aims to quantitatively determine the influence of FinTech development on renewable energy consumption. To this end, it uses a balanced panel of 21 OECD countries for the period 2005–2018. The empirical model is estimated using the fixed-effects estimator with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. The findings indicate the existence of a significant positive relation between FinTech development and renewable energy use.

Integration of architecture, engineering, and building science with digital sustainability happens on a contributory intensity where intelligence is correlated with making the design and construction process more efficient. A critical consideration in this chapter is the consolidation of all aspects of digitization into one operational model. This is where digital sustainability with a human-cyber-physical scenario comes in to enhance performance and improve living conditions in the built environment. The applicability of intelligent technologies that incorporate distributed sensing and big data addresses characteristics like energy efficiency and heathy living. The chapter concludes with possible solutions for a safe and secure scenario, with the employment of blockchain technology as a measure to fortify and control the design and operation tools.}

Results indicate that in 2018, each \$1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for \$0.49 in health and climate damages in the US and \$0.37 in China. The similar value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change “cryptodamages” roughly match each \$1 of coin value created. We close with discussion of policy implications.}

Smart cities are based on autonomous and distributed infrastructure that includes intelligent information processing and control systems heterogeneous network infrastructure, and ubiquitous sensing involving millions of information sources Due to the continued growth of data volume and number of connected IoT devices, however, issues such as high latency, bandwidth bottlenecks, security and privacy, and scalability arise in the current smart city network architecture. Designing an efficient, secure, and scalable distributed architecture by bringing computational and storage resources closer to endpoints is needed to address the limitations of today’s smart city network. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid network architecture for the smart city by leveraging the strength of emerging Software Defined Networking and blockchain technologies. To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, our architecture is divided into two parts: core network and edge network. Through the design of a hybrid architecture, our proposed architecture inherits the strength of both centralized and distributed network architectures. We also propose a Proof-of-Work scheme in our model to ensure security and privacy. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of our proposed model, we simulate our model and evaluate it based on various performance metrics. The result of the evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed model.}

abstract = {Agricultural digitization is revolutionizing food production with promises to increase both yield and environmental sustainability through the reduction of chemical inputs. However, it is unclear whether the adoption of digital agricultural technologies can also play a role in preventing or reducing food loss and waste. Examples of technologies used in food loss and waste reduction include ‘smart packaging’ that changes colour as food spoils, or Blockchain and radio-frequency identification tags that track information to identify potential sources of contamination along the food supply chain. Here, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the role of digital agricultural technologies in enabling food loss and waste prevention/reduction or lack thereof from a global perspective. To explore the digital agricultural technologies-food loss and waste dynamics, this review employed four conceptual frameworks relevant to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12 and Target 12.3 to foster responsible consumption and production patterns and to halve per capita food waste respectively by 2030. The four frameworks include (i) environmental sustainability, (ii) economic efficiency, (iii) social equity, and (iv) substantive governance and policies. The review findings demonstrate that prohibitive investment costs and the digital divide between technology adaptors limit the wide uptake of digital agricultural technologies. Where adoptions were evident, the rationale to do so was centered on boosting economic gains, reducing food production costs, and/or alleviating food insecurity. Food loss and waste prevention was rarely the principal technology adoption driver. The dynamics between digital agricultural technologies and food loss and waste prevention deserve rigorous examination to support practical policy options that invigorate sustainable food systems.}

The results indicate that agricultural cooperatives have multiple impacts on their members and are considered an organizational format able to promote society’s development. The empirical study also reveals two factors/dimensions that confirm the social importance of wine cooperatives in society: (1) reaction and (2) cooperation. Despite the difficulties in improving their competitiveness, cooperatives are seen as important vehicles for mobilization of local resources into a critical mass and their cooperators can achieve significant economic and social benefits from participation. In this sense, social entrepreneurship plays a vital role in the process of society/community development as well as making a significant contribution to cooperators. Implications for theory and practice are also suggested.}

This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors. This involves integration of several information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence, protocols, Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) etc. This paper discusses and extensively reviews the role of enabling technologies in smart cities. The paper further highlights the challenges and limitations in the development of smart cities along with the mitigation strategies. Specifically, three categories of challenges are identified namely technical, socio-economic and environmental giving specifics of each category. Finally, some of the best practices for attaining sustainable smart cities are provided.}

Distributed off-grid renewable generation has the ability to supply energy to remote communities while smart microgrids are able to effectively integrate intermittent renewable resources through management procedures that improve reliability, resiliency and sustainability. Microgrid control systems are typified by a hierarchical nature with multi-layered functionalities and capabilities to ensure optimized operations through strategic energy management and power flow balancing. This paper considers transactive energy management principles for supply/demand coordination and demonstrates that the concept is effective in managing energy demand response and data flow dynamics in the context of rural community-based energy systems. A transactive energy management system is modeled for rural village DC microgrids, and evaluated through demonstrative computer simulations. It shows how smart microgrid load control switching on homogeneous load groups is commanded through microgrid economic value signals that are adjustable by home owners to meet village and household energy budget constraints. The proposed approach is novel in that it offers a low complexity coordination framework, based on market principles, and demand response mechanisms for multi-priority grouping control of non-intelligent devices in off-grid rural village settings.}

abstract = {The real time Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading have ameliorated the smart city environment. Electric Vehicles (EVs) in smart cities have made it possible to balance the energy demand and supply without burdening the power grids. They also help in minimizing both the heap amounts of pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions. EVs not only charge their batteries from Charging Stations (CSs), but when the smart city faces energy deficiency, they supply their surplus energy to the power grids to fulfill energy demand as well. In addition, EVs also balance the energy demand and supply through energy trading at the local level during peak hours, which strengthens V2V energy trading. However, some issues, such as security threats and privacy leakage prevent EVs from participating in the energy trading process. In addition, the lack of incentives and knowledge about the cost of reaching the energy trading place within minimum time are also big challenges. Therefore, to solve the aforementioned challenges, a secure and efficient scheme for V2V and V2G energy trading is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme also helps in promoting environmental friendliness and making the smart cities sustainable and reliable. In the proposed scheme, energy trading transactions are secured using consortium blockchain, wherein the Local Aggregators (LAGs) are selected as authorized nodes. LAGs perform their role as energy brokers and are responsible for validating the energy trading requests using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. Moreover, a solution to find accurate distance with required expenses and time to reach the charging destination is also proposed, which effectively guides EVs to reach the relevant CSs and encourages energy trading. Besides, we propose a fair payment mechanism using a smart contract to avoid financial irregularities. An incentive provisioning mechanism is also given in the proposed work to prevent EVs from acting selfishly. The efficient power flow having minimized losses in the vehicular network is of much importance. Therefore, the energy losses incurred in both V2G and V2V are discussed in this work. Furthermore, Oyente is used for smart contract’s security analysis and for testing Ethereum’s resilience against different security flaws. Two attacker models are proposed and the security analyses of the models are also provided. The analyses show that the proposed system is robust against the double spending and Sybil attacks. Finally, the efficient performance of our proposed scheme is validated and analyzed. The simulation results proved that our proposed work outperforms existing work in terms of providing a secure and efficient energy trading platform for both V2G and V2V environments.}

Thus why, universal access to the grid with high cybersecurity, and reliability is needed to solve all these challenges. The digital twin concept turns a new dimension of technology into the world. Electric Digital Twin grid can perform online analysis of the grid in real-time and integrates all the past and present data and express the current grid status to the producers and consumers and also predicts the future grid status. Thus, the power grid transmission loss and location of the overheated line and power connection missing can be detected in addition decision-making and self-healing can possible. The future prediction saves the power grid from small to long accidents such as power outages and even blackout problems. The whole consumers and nation feel relief from these types of accidents and saves from large economic and business loss. The blockchain-enabled digital twin grid provides high security for the grid from cyberattacks. The paper conveys the framework of the electric digital twin grid and the concept of the DT grid processing and the way of serving the producer, prosumers, consumers even the whole nation in infrastructure, education, research, economic, business, and political development.}

We aim to fill this knowledge gap by providing evidence from the first real-world trial of a P2P electricity market facilitated by blockchain technology across a regulated electricity network. We apply sustainability transition and innovation thinking to analyse the trial participants as users shaping the P2P-related innovation process. Supported by our empirical results, we found that users joined the P2P market trial to learn and co-create the future of prosumer-centred electricity markets. We also found that if P2P is to enter the mainstream market, the assistance of other actors (e.g., intermediaries and activists) is important in order to cross the chasm to reach the majority of users and move from a learning and probing phase to breakthrough and wide diffusion.}

These prosumers (producers and consumers of electricity) could help drive electricity sector transformation, but at present electricity trading is associated with a lack of control and power held by consumers. Peer-to-peer trading schemes between energy consumers are increasingly being reported in the trade press as a new way to empower consumers, especially since the advent of blockchain, an emergent technology that could facilitate the adoption of such schemes. Research to understand how and why electricity trading occurs has received little attention within literature thus far. In this study we investigated the existing elements of electricity trading. A total of 16 structured interviews with domestic consumers, business consumers, domestic prosumers and business prosumers were undertaken. All interviews identified ease of payment as a key theme for electricity trading (although we note that ease may be in tension with sustainability and greater awareness of energy-related environmental impacts). Consumer interviews also identified lack of engagement with the process of receiving energy, and cost, as key themes. Prosumer interviews identified positive associations with power, and personal and business image, as key themes. Therefore, it is recommended that these factors be incorporated into the user interface of blockchain systems, to potentially increase adoption for peer-to-peer trading.}

abstract = {Background
Food safety has garnered much worldwide attention recently for reasons that are, unfortunately, not always positive. Traceability system (TS) is designed to assure safe and good quality food, while reducing the costs of food recalls. It should encompass all stakeholders, including governments, companies, and consumers, each of whom has an important role in the implementation and guardianship of such systems. The EU and China are amongst the main players implementing TS and are constantly exploring new opportunities and monitoring challenges for TS in a time of shifting consumer demands and rapid new technology innovation.
Scope and approach
This article states development stages from TS 1.0 to 3.0. and reviews TS development in a number of key countries and regions. Comparisons between the EU and China are drawn in terms of government, corporate, and consumer involvement in traceability.
Key findings and conclusions
A functional TS, while providing bi-directional communication between trading partners, must meet the laws and regulations where it operates. A functional system must also consider consumer value and perception, which varies with geography. There are a variety of promising technologies available on the market today to modernize TS, including artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. A key finding of this research is that both the EU and China have developed significant trade links in recent years which will certainly positively impact both economies. Key to underpinning the sustainability of these trade links will be the adoption of common TS to prevent negative associations.}

abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy markets are a widely discussed approach toward a sustainable energy supply that allows private owners of distributed energy resources (e.g., solar panels) and consuming households to trade energy directly without intermediaries. P2P energy markets are expected to contribute to a green, local, and fair energy system in the future. The approach implies a paradigm shift regarding the role of citizens who evolve from passive consumers into active market participants. While first existing research primarily focused on the technical feasibility of such scenarios, end users and their role in P2P markets have received little attention. The present article studies the behavior of 35 households and two commercial entities in Switzerland's first real-world P2P energy market. In this unique real-world setting, based on a mixed methods approach, we developed and deployed a web application and empirically studied interaction, acceptance, and participation in electricity pricing in this P2P energy market, using data from system logs, surveys, and interviews. The findings are threefold. First, the P2P energy market was well received among its users, indicated by comparably high and stable usage activity of the web application throughout the study (4.5 months). Second, users in the sample are heterogeneous; based on their engagement with the web application and their stated preferences, they can be categorized into those who want to actively set prices (30\%); those who prefer automated prices determined by an information system (35\%); and non-users/non-respondents to surveys (35\%). Third, an analysis of interviews with nine households suggests that P2P energy markets may increase the salience of renewable energies and may promote load-shifting activities. Thus, the article provides empirical insights about the user behavior of households and their future role in decentralized energy scenarios.}

In this commentary, we offer our view about the subject, specifically focusing in the practice area of Community Pharmacy. Our choice takes into account the fact that this by far the most numerous group within the profession, and where the fear of redundancy has always been looming since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Envisioned technologies will become a reality, but by now are not mature enough to be the disrupters everyone expects. Moreover, without major shifts in the legal environment regulating the organization of health care and the provision of medicines, big players will find it difficult to substitute pharmacies. As for pharmacists, they have always adapted to the challenges presented by technological revolutions. We argue that for the coming Patient Centred era, it is more important to continue to focus on the sustainability of an enhanced role for community pharmacists, providing services that highlight pharmacists' social role, measuring outcomes, and managing populations’ health.}

The role of AI in industrial design, which is the practice of improving the function, value and aesthetics of products to optimise customer satisfaction, has not yet been extensively explored. To effectively synthesise the existing literature, an unsupervised learning-enabled review methodology is proposed in this study. Important journals and articles are identified by using k-means clustering, and the relevant articles are analysed by using co-citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-occurrence analyses. Six clusters of the body of knowledge are then extracted, and naming of the clusters is assisted by using document summarisation and evaluation. Consequently, six intellectual cores related to AI in industrial design are formulated: (i) supply chain perspectives on product design and innovation, (ii) manufacturability and performance of new product development, (iii) intelligent tools and systems for industrial design and engineering, (iv) applied intelligence for product and service innovation, (v) industry 4.0 technologies for design and manufacturing, and (vi) blockchain-enabled artificial intelligence in industry 4.0. Future research trends on sustainable design, trust in AI, and emerging technology integration towards the next-generation AI in industrial design are discussed.}

Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability.}

The core of smart agriculture is big data, but the current big data management model still has certain hidden problems. The application of block chain technology can better realize the sharing of agricultural data. This article is based on block chain technology to study agricultural data sharing and sustainable development of ecological environment. This article conducts an in-depth analysis of the advantages of block chain-based big data sharing, and establishes a block chain-based big data sharing model. In order to improve the problems of significant regional and independent information of major agricultural information websites, this article also analyzes the agricultural data sharing technology, develops an agricultural information sharing system combined with the cloud computing platform, and links the characteristics of agricultural data to common data integration and the sharing method has been improved. According to the experimental data in the agricultural information exchange platform, users' attention to agricultural product production data is as high as 26.2\%, and their attention to agricultural consumption accounts for 25.6\%. It can be seen that many users are willing to complete the exchange of agricultural data on the platform. A cross-regional agricultural information exchange platform can improve the scattered distribution of agricultural data in the past, and provide agricultural production decisions for users in need through data analysis, and promote the sustainable development of agricultural economy. The innovation of this article is to make full use of blockchain technology to realize agricultural data sharing and sustainable development of the ecosystem. Through the combination of quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis, theoretical research and empirical research, it highlights decentralization from multiple angles. The mechanism can actually solve agricultural problems and achieve ecological sustainable development.}

A well-defined system paradigm and EA help enterprises in adopting appropriate manufacturing resources and technologies, optimizing plans, schedules, and controls of production lines, and coping with complexity, changes, and uncertainties of business processes cost-effectively. It is understandable that a system paradigm should be evolved along with the availability and advancement of advanced manufacturing technologies; on the other hand, new system paradigms are mostly inspired by some successful manufacturing applications of new information technologies (ITs). One of the recently developed system paradigms is Digital Manufacturing (DM) where Digital Twin (DT-I) is used to describe the interactions of virtual and physical entities. This paper discusses the concepts of DM and DT-I and rationalizes the relations of DM and DT-I; in particular, the origin and evolution of DT-I are explored in details to identify its limitations to be used as an EA for DM. It is our finding that existing IT concepts show their limitations in supporting smooth transitions when systems have to be reconfigured in dealing with long-term changes in Sustainable Manufacturing, and this is evidenced by the fact of the trend of the shortened lifespans of modern enterprises even with the aids of rapidly developed digital technologies in decades. To overcome these limitations, a new concept so called Digital Triad (DT-II) is coined and the Internet of Digital Triad Things (IoDTT) is proposed as an information integration (II) solution for digital manufacturing enterprises, and their application is illustrated through a reconfigurable robotic system example. The rationales and significances of DT-II and IoDTT as well as future research directions of DM are summarized as a conclusion.}

In recent years, however, there have been several data breaches and other security and privacy incidents involving IoT devices, which have attracted significant attention from the research community in both academia and industry. This has resulted in a surge of proposals put forward by many researchers, including IoT blockchain-based security solutions, IoT intrusion detection systems, IoT authentication systems, and IoT security analytics. While these proposals are aimed at addressing various IoT security and privacy-related issues, many of these solutions arguably seem not to focus on helping designers and developers with little or no security expertise in start-up companies to produce secure IoT systems. To this end, the IoT Hardware Platform Security Advisor (IoT-HarPSecA) framework was proposed to foster the design and implementation of secure IoT systems. In this paper, we present the performance and usability evaluation of the Security Requirements Elicitation (SRE) and Security Best Practice Guidelines (SBPG) component tools of IoT-HarPSecA, which are two of the three component tools of the security framework. Results show that the two components of the IoT-HarPSecA framework can facilitate the development of secure IoT systems and that the SRE and SBPG tools are easy to use.}

The challenges around cybersecurity, standards, data quality, integrating new technologies, and potentially competing interests among stakeholders are discussed. We examine the traceability of wood products, which are important globally and raise significant sustainability challenges. The case illustrates how technical solutions can be incorporated into the traceability system to respond to the needs and challenges of stakeholders. Further research is needed on the technical, policy, and business strategy solutions to address common data and technology challenges for effective traceability systems.}

abstract = {Many organizations are confronted with the challenge of improving supply chain transparency not only to meet regulatory requirements, but also to optimize operations, guarantee the quality of outputs, and ensure the sustainability of processes. As this topic has garnered significant interest across a wide range of academic disciplines, there is a need to synthesize and categorize these diverse contributions to inspire future investigations of emerging or under-researched substantive areas. This article addresses this need by reviewing existing research on supply chain transparency and offers an integrated understanding of this growing literature. By analyzing a sample of over 300 peer-reviewed articles through bibliometric and automated text mining methods, we identify six distinct clusters that represent substantive literature subdomains: transparency technologies, knowledge integration, governance, sustainability, traceability, and resilience. Building on these structured analyses, we develop a literature framework to comprehensively organize insights from these clusters and illustrate the conceptual relationships between transparency management systems, transparency vehicles, and transparency outcomes. By providing a holistic examination of how supply chain transparency is enabled, our framework aids researchers' future studies and guides practitioners’ strategies to identify, diagnose, and address modern challenges that face supply chains (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, workplace exploitation, increased third-party scrutiny).}

All around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic affects different dimensions of SCs, including but not limited to finance, lead time, demand changes, and production performance. There is an urgent need to respond to this grand challenge. The catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted scholars to develop innovative SC disruption management strategies and disseminate them via numerous scientific articles. However, there is still a lack of systematic literature survey studies that aim to identify promising SC disruption management strategies through the bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses. In order to address this drawback, this study presents a set of up-to-date bibliometric, network, and thematic analyses to identify the influential contributors, main research streams, and disruption management strategies related to the SC performance under the COVID-19 settings. The conducted analyses reveal that resilience and sustainability are the primary SC topics. Furthermore, the major research themes are found to be food, health-related SCs, and technology-aided tools (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), and blockchains). Various disruption management strategies focusing on resilience and sustainability themes are extracted from the most influential studies that were identified as a part of this work. In addition, we draw some managerial insights to ensure a resilient and sustainable supply of critical products in the event of a pandemic, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and vaccines.}

abstract = {There is a wide recognition that block chain technology will play a central role in many sectors. In fact, this technology is a promising opportunity to ensure security, traceability, privacy and transparency in most digitized human activities. The supply chain of hazardous materials is a typical sensitive industrial activity that require a high level of vigilance. The various stakeholders of such supply chain need to share crucial data using high secure channels while ensuring traceability. However, the block chain is currently an energy-intensive technology. In this context, the challenge is to minimize the risk related to the hazardous materials supply chain using an eco-friendly and cost effective block chain. In this paper, we propose a green-block chain based framework for the hazardous materials supply chain. Two mathematical models are proposed for the energy management consumed by block-chain transactions. The first, minimises the total consumed energy by a set of servers by providing the optimal assignment of computing tasks over the time periods. The second, minimises both the CO2 emissions and the cost of a grid energy mix. To prove the applicability of the proposed framework, a Block-chain prototype is implemented to simulate an IOT-based supply chain of hazardous materials. Results show that the proposed system may help to ensure the security of dangerous goods transportation. Furthermore, the energy management using optimization modelling would provide CO2 emissions savings and thus ensure sustainability of block-chain transactions.}

abstract = {Rapid global changes (population growth, urbanization and frequent extreme weather conditions) have cumulatively affected local water bodies and resulted in unfavorable hydrological, ecological, and environmental changes in the major river systems. Particularly, communities in isolated riverine islands are heavily affected due to their poor adaptive capacities, which is well documented in the contemporary literature. The focal point for the vulnerability of these people lies in the water resources (drinking water availability, agricultural water quality, salt-water intrusion, flooding etc.) and the future interaction between human and water systems. This paper advocates the importance of socio-hydrological research in the context of enhancing social adaptive capacity as well as for developing a resilient water environment in three very large riverine islands in Asia: Fraserganj (India), Dakshin Bedkashi (Bangladesh) (both from the Ganges-Brahaputra-Meghna Delta) and Con Dao Island (Mekong River, Vietnam). It also explores how the nexus of human–water relations could be applied to improve adaptive measures to manage local water needs while mitigating undesirable changes to the hydrological cycle. Socio-hydrological models as an integrated tool can be used to quantify the feedbacks between water resources and society at multiple scales, with the aim of expediting stakeholder participation for sustainable water resource management. The proposed idea in this study will be helpful to sketch projections of alternatives that explicitly account for plausible and co-evolving trajectories of the socio-hydrological system, which will yield both insights into cause–effect relationships and help stakeholders to identify safe functioning space.}

Their goal is to design, engineer, and manage behaviors of high-performing postharvest systems. Such systems are likely to work effectively with information to support marketing, quality assurance, and postharvest operations. They continually learn how to better meet new conditions, maximizing use of virtuous cycles to deliver innovation. Ongoing discoveries about the human microbiome seem likely to reshape perceptions of fresh produce quality over the coming decades. Technologies such as blockchain may provide a new basis for trust among participants in postharvest systems. Postharvesters with strong systems thinking and management skills will be central to improved access to fresh fruits and vegetables for the world’s peoples everywhere. They will face challenges of meeting further growth in global demand for food in ways that avoid further losses to sustainability of the global ecology.

To further strengthen this collaboration, Hyperledger Fabric (HF) can be prominently considered as a mean to implement next-generation secure and intelligent communication. However, implementing real-world applications on this platform may concern performance issues. For the constructive exploration of these issues, initially, we design a novel P2P energy trading framework for improving resource utilization and consequently addressing the impending electricity crisis challenge. Thenceforward, we evaluate the results based on the different system operational parameters for establishing a proof-of-concept. For determining performance bottlenecks and best-configuration, these results are investigated independently by using the Nectar Research Cloud, thereby sustaining scalability. The proposed evaluation approach will largely contribute to determining the system operational-level parameters of enterprise applications that will utilize the HF platform as their communication tool-support. In addition, a benchmark is presented based on the Hyperledger Caliper tool to facilitate application designers and developers in the form of selecting an appropriate implementation model across the two latest stable HF model versions. The illustrative CPS-enabled energy trading scenario corroborates the feasibility of the proposed framework to foster the development of HF-assisted smart P2P energy trading mechanisms.}

Cold chain logistics (CCL) is not only vital for maintaining the quality and safety of fresh agro-products and reducing losses but also provides important support to help increase farmer income and thereby promote the revitalization of rural industry in China. In recent years, numerous studies have focused on improving the efficiency and sustainability of CCL, and the results have important implications for promoting innovation, applying technologies, improving facilities and equipment, and optimizing management in the CCL industry.
Scope and approach
This review discusses active research areas, gaps in the existing state of research, and future research challenges for CCL. Furthermore, we summarize the current status of China's CCL industry and technology and compare the state of CCL development in China with that in more developed countries in terms of infrastructure, data handling, and national policies.
Key findings and conclusions
The future trends of CCL involve low carbon strategies and intelligent innovation, which are the key to meeting environmental concerns and the evolving needs of the market. Advances in next-generation information technology (including IoT, blockchain, AI, etc.) have significantly accelerated the modernization of CCL. Meanwhile, attaining these dual objectives of a low-carbon footprint and intelligent innovation requires cooperation between national regulators, industry, consumers, and interdisciplinary experts. A key finding of this review is that national policy and financial intervention in China are expected to be the main forces behind renovating infrastructure and upgrading standardization, which is required to narrow the CCL development gap between China and other more developed nations.}

E-waste represents a growing threat to our environment, from toxic chemicals and heavy metals leaching into soils, to air and water pollutions caused by improper recycling. Here we present a methodology to estimate Bitcoin's e-waste and find that it adds up to 30.7 metric kilotons annually, per May 2021. This number is comparable to the amount of small IT and telecommunication equipment waste produced by a country like the Netherlands. At peak Bitcoin price levels seen early in 2021, the annual amount of e-waste may grow beyond 64.4 metric kilotons in the midterm, which highlights the dynamic trend if the Bitcoin price rises further. Moreover, the demand for mining hardware already today disrupts the global semiconductor supply chain. The strategies we present may help to mitigate Bitcoin's growing e-waste problem.}

However, inflammation provoked by FO replacement limited its widely application in fish industry. In order to understand the mechanism of VO-induced inflammation, this study investigated the impact of different dietary vegetable oils on the intestinal health and microbiome in carnivorous marine fish golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus). Three diets supplemented with fish oil (FO, rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids), soybean oil (SO, rich in 18:2n-6) and linseed oil (LO, rich in 18:3n-3), respectively, were fed on juvenile golden pompano for 8 weeks, and the intestinal histology, digestive enzymes activities, immunity and antioxidant indices as well as intestinal microbiome were determined. The results showed that dietary SO significantly impaired intestinal health, and decreased the number and height of intestinal folds, and muscle thickness, as well as the zonula occludens-1 (zo-1) mRNA expression in intestine. Moreover, the two dietary VO significantly decreased the amylase and lipase activities in intestine, and reduced the trypsin activity in the dietary SO group. Furthermore, the two VO diets increased intestinal acid phosphatase (ACP) activity, while intestinal lysozyme (LZM) activity and serum diamine oxidase (DAO) activity in the SO group were also significantly increased (P < 0.05). Analysis of the intestinal microbiota showed that the two VO diets significantly increased the abundance of intestinal potentially pathogenic bacteria (Mycoplasma and Vibrio) and decreased proportions of intestinal probiotics (Bacillus and Lactococcus), especially in the dietary SO group. These results indicate that complete replacement of FO with VO in diets would induce intestinal inflammation and impair intestinal function, which might be due to changes in intestinal microbiota profiles, and that dietary SO would have a more negative effect compared to dietary LO on intestinal health in T. ovatus.}

Forecasting what constitutes a disruptive technology for the agri-food industry is complicated as the impact is more likely to be measured from a retrospective downstream reflective process. DTs can substantially cause localized change within a market or industry (i.e., first-order disruption) and cause ground-breaking changes across many cross-cutting domains (i.e., second-order disruption) over short or more extended time periods that substantially influence societal norms. Modern-day and future food disruption will be influenced by growing demand to produce more safe nutritious food to meet increasing populations that will respond to dynamic changes in eating habits, personalized nutrition, and consumer attitudes toward alternative protein sources and climate change. Exploiting advances in information communications technology and advanced manufacturing (such as the Internet of Things, big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotics, augment and virtual reality, 3D printing) will inform creative disruption such as security, packaging, and enhanced online delivery in the food supply chain that is comprehensively addressed throughout this book. A review of the recent 43 projects funded by the Irish government under Science Foundation Ireland’s Disruptive Technology initiative highlighted trends in the innovation ecosystem and the potential for both cross-cutting and future food disruption with global outreach and orientation.

COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global lockdown that has abruptly shut down core businesses and caused a worldwide recession. The forecast for a smooth transition for the agri-food and drink industry is, at best, alarming. Given that COVID-19 shutdown multiple core services (such as aviation, food services, supply chains, and export and import markets), there is an enormous deficiency in critical information to inform priority decision making for companies where this uncertainly is likely to impact negatively upon recovery.
Scope and approach
The current article investigates potential innovations within the era of the COVID-19 crisis after framing them within the four issues of the food sector (food safety, bioactive food compounds, food security, and sustainability) that are directly affected by the pandemic. The prospect of foreseen innovations to disrupt the food sector during lockdown periods and the post-COVID-19 era is also discussed.
Key findings and conclusions
Internet and Communication Technologies, blockchain in the food supply chain and other Industry 4.0 applications, as well as approaches that redefine the way we consume food (e.g., lab-grown meat, plant-based alternatives of meat, and valorization of a vast range of bioresources), are the innovations with the highest potential in the new era. There is also an equally pressing need to exploit social marketing to understand attitudes, perceptions, and barriers that influence the behavior change of consumers and the agri-food industry. Subsequently, this change will contribute to adapting to new norms forged by the COVID-19 pandemic, where there is a significant gap in knowledge for decision making.}

abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA)-free epoxy resins, synthesized from low molecular weight cycloaliphatic compounds, may represents promising materials for stone conservation due to their very appealing and tunable physico-chemical properties, such as viscosity, curing rate and penetration ability, being also easy to apply and handle. Furthermore, alkoxysilanes have been widely employed as inorganic strengtheners since they are easily hydrolysed inside lithic substrates affording SiO linkages with the stone matrix. Taking into account the advantages of these two classes of materials, this work has been focused on the development of innovative conservation materials, based on hybrid epoxy-silica BPA-free resins obtained by reaction of 1,4-cycloexanedimethanol diglycidylether (CHDM-DGE) with various siloxane precursors, i.e. glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane (GPTMS), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and isobutyltrimethoxysilane (iBuTMS), using the 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO) as epoxy hardener. Thanks to Raman spectroscopy the synthesis processes have been successfully monitored, allowing the identification of oxirane rings opening as well as the formation of the cross-linked organic-inorganic networks. In accordance with the spectroscopic data, the thermal studies carried out by TGA and DSC techniques have pointed that GPTMS is a suitable siloxane precursor to synthesize the most stable samples against temperature degradation. GPTMS-containing resins have also shown good performances in the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and in contact angle investigations, with values indicating considerable hydrophobic properties. SEM analyses have highlighted a great homogeneity over the entire observed areas, without formations of clusters and/or aggregates bigger than 45 μm, for the cited materials, confirming the efficiency of GPTMS as coupling agent to enhance the organic/inorganic interphase bonding. The variations provided by the incorporation of nanostructured titania, specifically synthesized, inside the epoxy-silica hybrids have been also evaluated. According to all the collected results, the hybrid materials here reported have proven to be promising multifunctional products for potential application in the field of stone conservation.}

For this purpose, a cycloaliphatic diol, with minor health and environmental associated issues with respect to classic phenolic derivatives, was selected to synthesize a BPA-free bio-based epoxy resins precursor, 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol diglycidylether (CBDO-DGE). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopies were employed to assess the synthesis and clean-up procedures. In addition, both 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR in solution were used to ascertain the structure and purity of the bio-based epoxy. The development of the epoxy thermosets by 1,8- diaminooctane (DAO), triethylenetetramine (TETA) and 5-amino-1,3,3-trimethylcyclohexanemethylamine (IPDA) curing agents was followed by attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopies, whereas their suitability as organic counterpart of the hybrids was established by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TGA) measurements. In addition, epoxy-silica hybrids were obtained by exploiting sol-gel technology, carrying out the epoxy hardening reactions also in the presence of (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and octyltriethoxysilane (OcTES), as silica-forming additives. To investigate the properties of the resulting hybrid materials imparted by the selection of the different reactants, various blends were studied by a combination of scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), ATR FT-IR and Raman analysis. Furthermore, the assessment of the hybrids tunability as materials for stone conservation was ascertained in terms of thermostability and hydrophobicity by TG-DTA, DSC, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and contact angle measurements.}

The security of such critical cyber-physical infrastructure is considered as a major priority for both industry and academia. In this paper, we propose a new distributed smart-contract based control approach of BESSs to enable collaborative and secure operations among them. We present a comprehensive discussion on how control strategies can be implemented as smart contracts and deployed on a distributed network of BESSs nodes in order to operate these storage systems according to secure consensus. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we analyze the vulnerabilities of BESSs when controlled according to traditional schemes vs. smart-contract enabled control. Simulation results show that if individual BESSs achieve a certain maximum threshold of exploitability, then the network of distributed BESSs is more robust to cyber-attacks in smart contract-defined control.}

Ignorance of sustainability aspects has led many manufacturing organisations to face huge financial losses. It has been observed that developed nations have successfully achieved sustainability in their manufacturing sectors. However, the rate of sustainability adoption in developing nations is significantly poorer. The current business trend offers new technologies such as the Internet of Things, Big data analytics, Blockchain, Machine learning, etc. These technologies can be termed under the Industry 4.0 paradigm when considered within a manufacturing context. It is significant to notice that such new technologies directly or indirectly contribute to sustainability. So, it is necessary to explore the enablers that facilitate sustainability adoption. This study aims to develop a framework to improve sustainability adoption across manufacturing organisations of developing nations using Industry 4.0 technologies. Initially, the enablers that strongly influence sustainability adoption are identified through a literature review. Further, a large scale survey is conducted to finalise the Industry 4.0 technologies’ enablers to be included in the framework. Based on the empirical analysis, a framework is developed and tested across an Indian manufacturing case organisation. Finally, Robust Best Worst Method (RBWM) is utilised to identify the intensity of influence of each enabler included in the framework. The findings of the study reveal that managerial and economical, and environmental enablers possess a strong contribution toward sustainability adoption. The outcomes of the present study will be beneficial for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.}

There has been significant progress in healthcare. However, the lack of emotive recognition coupled with a dearth of personalized and pervasive health applications and emotive smart devices calls for the integration of intelligent sensors health systems through emerging technologies. Although there has been significant progress in smart and connected health care, more research innovation, dissemination and technologies are needed to unbundle new opportunities and move towards healthcare 5.0. Healthcare is at the dawn of a paradigm change to reach the new era of smart disease control and detection, virtual care, smart health management, smart monitoring, and decision-making. Therefore, this study discusses the roles and capacities of sensors, their capabilities and other emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, 5 G technologies, drone technology, blockchain, robotics, big data, internet of things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. Healthcare 5.0 provides healthcare services including patient remote monitoring, tracking and virtual clinics, emotive telemedicine, ambient assisted living, smart self-management, wellness monitoring and control, smart treatment reminders, compliance and adherence, and personalized and connected health care. However, building resilience and robust healthcare 5.0 is not immune to challenges. Organizational challenges, technological and infrastructural barriers, lack of legal and regulatory frameworks and e-health policies, individual perceptions, misalignment with hospitals’ strategy, lack of funding, religious and cultural barriers are identified as potential barriers to the successful implementation of healthcare 5.0. Therefore, there is a need for building resilient technology-driven healthcare systems. To achieve this, there is a need for expanding technological infrastructure, provision of budgetary support based on sustainable business models, develop appropriate legal and e-health policies, standardization and synchronization of protocols, improving stakeholders’ engagement and involvement and establishment of private and public partnerships and investments.}

Beside such technologies in physical sciences, digitalization technologies have increasingly positive impacts on the cost efficient operation and investment planning of the solar energy investments and keep the current cost decline trajectory for the PV industry. One option to achieve this may be through digital financial innovations such as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based crowdfunding for project finance. This option would enable multiple small investors to offer loans with lower interest rates and longer debt tenors than traditional financiers, such as banks, while increasing the acceptable debt fraction for a project due to the higher risk tolerance of individual investors coupled with the risk reduction that this innovation could allow. This new aspect of the digital partial ownership of the energy projects is demonstrated using a functional DLT-based crowdfunding mechanism. Furthermore, impacts of the proposed approach is demonstrated by calculating the LCOE values for the European countries by comparing with the traditional investment options. According to the findings of this study digitalization technologies especially DLT has positive impact in terms of reducing the financial costs and also LCOE values of solar energy projects. Additionally, these estimated cost values are used for analyzing the grid parity of PV systems in each assessed country. This article presents a digitization based methodology that has a high potential to accelerate the Digital Green Shift in future.}

Industry 4.0 and logistics 4.0 are the consequence of this situation. Methods and concepts are defined for transforming companies and making them more competitive on the market. Industry 4.0 and logistics 4.0 concepts imply the integration of new technologies and organizations such as robots, cobots, tracking (RFID), IoT, Blockchain, etc. A framework, based on sustainability as the kernel of company transformation, in the frame of industry 4.0, has been developed in Icam (Engineer High school). This paper presents results of this application to a joinery with the objective to define a reference model corresponding to this activity sector. This reference model, in addition to a decision aided tool being developed will be used for transforming companies (of this sector) in the frame of industry 4.0 implementation concepts. A dashboard has been developed for measuring the company initial state and defining results which would be obtained after transformations (target). Then, the dashboard is composed of main performance criteria: cost, lead time, quality and social, societal and environmental aspects. Then, simulation is used as a tool for testing scenarios and choosing changes required by the company. In this paper a literature review will present existing concepts, methods and tools (theory of systems, Industry 4.0 concepts, etc.) which could be used for defining the general approach, the decision aided tool and the joinery reference model, in order to transform with success a joinery company. Then, the general approach and dashboard generic framework will be exposed. Finally, an example of a joinery company will be used for illustrating concepts and tools presented.}

However, perhaps in all such things the major challenge faced by the smart cities is data privacy and security. In this paper we have discussed securing smart cities using block chain technology. A smart city uses many sensors and actuators, and it is relying completely on the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT). To maintain sustainability and real-time deployment of smart cities the necessary factors required are secured wireless connectivity and IoT. Being smarter also makes the city more vulnerable to cyber attacks. We have proposed a comprehensive survey about various applications such as healthcare systems, smart vehicles, smart trafficking, and smart economy sharing services in the smart cities, which implements blockchain technology. Case studies of smart Dubai and smart London have also been presented in this paper.}

abstract = {An emerging application of FinTech in the commodities market pivots on a blockchain-enabled Peer-to-Peer energy exchange platform, wherein solar energy feed-in tariffs are self-executed via “smart contracts”. With subsidy design versus mechanism design models, this paper evaluates the instrumental value of smart contracts towards poverty mitigation in developing economies via securing sustainable revenue for rural households. We investigate how the adoption levels of solar panels interact with adoption barriers and household energy behaviors. Smart contracts can be applied for self-executing the green energy financing and subsidy distribution process. For the government-led subsidy design scheme, we propose Cournot quantity competition models that incorporate spatial heterogeneity (energy-poor and energy-rich regions) and uncertainty in energy generation costs. We find that the government’s aggregate subsidy expenditure decreases in solar uncertainty, and it is optimal to select households from a single region only for high uncertainty. Smart contracts facilitate heterogeneity and uncertainty to soften quantity competition, benefitting households in both regions and the government. For the mechanism design scheme, we demonstrate that both regions can be chosen only under the incomplete information case with inaccurate forecasts about market conditions and a relatively low baseline energy price. The self-executing feature of smart contracts helps mitigate the potential risks of renegotiation between multiple parties. Moreover, a public policy supported by mechanism design is more likely to outperform that based on market competition regarding cost-effectiveness only when the latter chooses a single region. Otherwise, quantity competition would be significantly softened by contingency-dependent smart contracts under heterogeneous market conditions.}

abstract = {Rural areas in developing countries have constantly been plagued by poor sanitation and energy shortages. A key issue has been the decentralized nature of waste generation and energy consumption, leading to farmers burning crop stocks, lumber, and other agricultural waste. As 1.9 billion people lack access to waste collection services [1], untreated solid and liquid refuse hamper the health of many and irreversibly damage the local ecosystem. Considering the scattered nature of agricultural waste generation and centralized treatment difficulties, this study examines the feasibility of adopting decentralized blockchain system in trading biomass energy and agricultural products across the waste-to-energy ecosystem. A case study is conducted based on the Yitong system in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, China. This plant collects and transports agricultural wastes (crop straw and animal residue), and converts them to clean energy and agricultural by-products like briquettes, fertilizer, and animal feedstock. This paper presents how a digital coupon or cryptocurrency can be introduced to trade the wastes, energy and by-products among the farmers and entrepreneurs. It argues that this system could maximize the use of agriculture wastes by incentivizing farmers and enterprises to work together. This paper covers three key areas:1) Literature review, methodology preparation, and field assessment for introducing digital incentive mechanism to enhance rural wastes management.2) Design of a prototype of blockchain-based model: (a) how the waste-to-energy plant managers collect the segregated waste from individual farmers through trucks connected to blockchain-based smart meters; (b) how systems on each of the trucks register the quantity of waste received onto a universal ledger when collecting. This quantity received will be translated into a certain amount of energy and products like fertilizer that the waste-to-energy plant owes each farm; and (c) how the farmers will receive digital coupons corresponding to the quantity of energy and agricultural products that they should receive.3) Evaluation of the feasibility of blockchain-based model (technical and economic): (a) data collection on the total quantity of waste produced and the processing capabilities and availability of Waste to Energy plants; (b) assessing readiness of digital infrastructure (cyber-security and communications); and (c) economic evaluation of the incentives and responsibilities associated with the key stakeholders from the farmers to enterprises.}

Connecting these markets has the potential to allow a more integrated, efficient, and globally consistent price on carbon which will promote greater confidence in the market, investment, and, ultimately, help foster new technology development through new financial flows. The challenge to connecting carbon markets is that each individual carbon market has its own legal and regulatory framework as well as its own rules for assigning and accounting for the carbon units traded. Such legal and regulatory fragmentation presents significant legal and political hurdles. An alternative, “bottom-up” solution to enable carbon trading between markets without forcing legal and regulatory homogeneous standardization and conformity on those markets would be a more practical way to connect them. One candidate technology to facilitate such connection is the “Distributed Ledger” (DL) or Blockchain, which provides the combination of a distributed database with public/private key encryption and a decentralized infrastructure. This potentially allows for innovative solutions to data sharing, or transaction management application areas, making it a good first-order match to the emerging requirements for an interoperable carbon market infrastructure. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, a solution needs to be found that facilitates a global-scale distributed infrastructure, which allows a diverse set of markets and participants to utilize and exploit it. The established literature on innovation and technology diffusion gives some guidance on this issue, but not the ability to predict success. The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to outline the most important questions identified regarding the connecting of carbon markets through the application of DL technologies, and share the authors’ current thoughts on those questions.}

This paper focuses on the dairy industry, on its need to adapt to the current market by becoming more resource efficient, environment-friendly, transparent and secure. The Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing (EC) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) are all crucial to the achievement of those improvements because they allow to digitize all parts of the value chain, providing detailed information to the consumer on the final product and ensuring its safety and quality. In Smart Farming environments, IoT and DLT enable resource monitoring and traceability in the value chain, allowing producers to optimize processes, provide the origin of the produce and guarantee its quality to consumers. In comparison to a centralized cloud, EC manages the Big Data generated by IoT devices by processing them at the network edge, allowing for the implementation of services with shorter response times, and a higher Quality of Service (QoS) and security. This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production. The platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a dairy farm, demonstrating that the implementation of EC contributes to a reduction in data traffic and an improvement in the reliability in communications between the IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud.}

It is related to not only business and marketing, but also energy system operation to keep secure and reliable with injection of new roles, new utilization patterns, and new markets. This paper investigates the socio-technical interaction and mechanism for the sustainable P2P energy trading from the social dimension on the cooperation of multi-level market players, the technical dimension on the cutting-edge exchange of flexibility, and the economical dimension on the inter-operative decentralized/regulated marketplaces. Three questions are targeted on: (1) How Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enables co-creation of decentralized heterogeneous user-centered digital frameworks for the large-scale P2P trading interaction, (2) What specific energy services drive the cross-border interactions for exchange of multi-scale P2P flexibility, (3) How operational framework in P2P energy trading achieves the inter-operative marketplaces with the formation of trusted P2P energy society and the injection of multi-scale flexibility services. Finally, regulation challenges on P2P energy trading implementation are discussed for the guide of future work.}

However, the precise pathways by which they can reach such ambitious goals have yet to be identified. As costs of photovoltaics (PV), batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs) are likely to keep falling, they can jointly play a key role for deep decarbonization. Here, we conduct a techno-economic analysis of a city-scale energy system with roof-top PV, batteries, and EVs for Kyoto City, Japan. We find that aggressive EV adoption and the use of EVs for electricity storage could help roof-top PV penetration in the city with substantially lower costs than just deploying PV and batteries alone or allowing EV to charge only. CO2 emissions from vehicle and electricity usage in the city could be reduced by 60–74\% if the entire current car fleet is replaced by EVs while also reducing energy costs by 22–37\% by 2030. The largest challenge of a city-wide “PV + EV” system (named as “Solar-EV city”) is its implementation. We explore how it could be realized in Kyoto through peer-to-peer (P2P) power trading/blockchain technology initially on a community scale as smart microgrids, then gradually expanding/converging into a city-wide. For the transition to decentralized power systems, citizen’s decision-making process is one of the keys to overcome social, institutional, and regulatory barriers.}

abstract = {Background
Evidence has suggested that exercise protects against cognitive decline in aging, but the recent lockdown measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have limited the opportunity for outdoor exercise. Herein we tested the effects of an indoor exercise, Qigong, on neurocognitive functioning as well as its potential neuro-immune pathway.
Methods
We conducted a 12-week randomized active-controlled trial with two study arms in cognitively healthy older people. We applied Wu Xing Ping Heng Gong (Qigong), which was designed by an experienced Daoist Qigong master, to the experimental group, whereas we applied the physical stretching exercise to the control group. The Qigong exercise consisted of a range of movements involving the stretching of arms and legs, the turning of the torso, and relaxing, which would follow the fundamental principles of Daoism and traditional Chinese medicine (e.g., Qi). We measured aging-sensitive neurocognitive abilities, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and brain structural volumes in the experimental (Qigong, n = 22) and control groups (stretching, n = 26) before and after the 12-week training.
Results
We observed that Qigong caused significant improvement in processing speed (t (46) = 2.03, p = 0.048) and sustained attention (t (46) = -2.34, p = 0.023), increased hippocampal volume (t (41) = 3.94, p < 0.001), and reduced peripheral IL-6 levels (t (46) = -3.17, p = 0.003). Moreover, following Qigong training, greater reduction of peripheral IL-6 levels was associated with a greater increase of processing speed performance (bootstrapping CI: [0.16, 3.30]) and a more significant training-induced effect of hippocampal volume on the improvement in sustained attention (bootstrapping CI: [-0.35, −0.004]).
Conclusion
Overall, these findings offer significant insight into the mechanistic role of peripheral IL-6—and its intricate interplay with neural processes—in the beneficial neurocognitive effects of Qigong. The findings have profound implications for early identification and intervention of older individuals vulnerable to cognitive decline, focusing on the neuro-immune pathway. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT04641429).}

However, the studies do not focus on the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector. Moreover, MSMEs face various challenges, including significant supply chain disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, there was an urgent requirement to shift to digital technologies to survive during this difficult time. In the context of MSME, various positive changes are discussed in the recent literature. However, a dearth of studies discusses the role of big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) to gain sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). Our study aims to fill this gap and answer this question – How do BDAC help MSMEs gain SCA? To understand the phenomenon, we receive theoretical support from organizational information processing theory (OIPT) and institutional theory (IT). We develop a conceptual framework that links BDAC and SCA through supply chain coordination, swift trust, and supply chain risk. Additionally, the age and size of the firm are used as control variables. The data is collected from Indian service sector employees of MSMEs, resulting in 497 usable responses. We use PLS-SEM using Warp PLS 7.0 to test the hypotheses. A critical finding is that the BDAC indirectly impacts the SCA. Finally, the other findings, limitations, and scope for future research are discussed.}

However, there is room for improvement in the current operation of the palm oil industry to achieve better sustainability development. The industrial revolution toward automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is the new trend known as the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). Unfortunately, the palm oil industry has been moving slowly in this revolution. This paper aims to conduct a detailed review of the current state of the palm oil industry development toward Industry 4.0. A novel Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) approach is adopted i) to ensure a detailed evaluation of the existing problems, and ii) to identify potential implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies in the palm oil industry. HAZOP is a common approach used in chemical engineering to systematically evaluate process safety and identify the possible improvement of the existing system. The same concept is applied in this paper to investigate the possible adaptation of Industry 4.0 technologies to improve the palm oil industry. Existing Industry 4.0 technologies and features were evaluated to identify feasible adaptation in the industry. The HAZOP review proposed 23 recommendations to improve the palm oil industry with Industry 4.0 technologies to achieve a higher standard in sustainable production. A total of 13 specific Industry 4.0 features were identified as the potential development gaps for palm oil industry stakeholders, which included the adaptation of Internet-of-Things sensors, cloud computing, blockchain, and smart imaging processing technologies.}

This article built a point-axis-region location driving system to analyze the spatial location differentiation of characteristic villages and towns (CVTS) using the kernel density model, and explored the mechanism of location driving factors with a geographical detector model. The results show that vegetables and fruits are the main types of products in CVTS. They account for 27.60\% and 34.68\% of all types of products, and occur mainly in the east and central regions of China. Moreover, all point-axis-region driving factors have a significant influence on grain crops. The mean values of driving forces of vegetables and fruits are larger than other types of CVTS, and their values are 0.12 and 0.11. The average driving forces on all CVTS in the northeast are higher than those in other regions, especially the driving forces of vegetables and medicinal crops (0.24 and 0.18, respectively). Finally, we proposed that the Chinese government should employ engineering technology, invest on road networks, e-commerce and blockchain technology to optimize the point-axis-region location advantages, to promote the sustainable development of CVTS. The detection of driving mechanisms on spatial location differentiation of CVTS has important research value for location theory and rural region systems research.}

What are the main research categories for each GIT life cycle phase (pre-adoption, adoption and post-adoption)? After presenting the systematic longitudinal review, the relevant academic discussion within each stage is presented. Results indicate that scholars currently focus on the post-adoption stage, investigating the external impacts of GIT solutions adopted by companies. GITs are increasingly studied in a social context, no longer restricted to the institutional environment, but there is still room for quali-quantitative research related to this phase. Finally, this research presents decision-making situations in adopting GIT (pre-adoption), the development of practices in organisations (adoption), and the benefits and metrics of the impact of implementation (post-adoption) for professionals interested in the subject. Limitations and future research avenues under the present study’s discussion topics and new discussion clusters such as cryptocurrency and blockchain are indicated.}

In this study, we first investigate the power grid modernization and the transition toward intelligent power systems. Smart grids introduce more reliable, secure, efficient, and sustainable energy delivery to the consumers by engaging demand side in load-generation balance. Further, we introduce blockchain-based energy trading as a means to expedite the decentralization of interdependent power and energy networks by enabling decentralized transactions and smart contracts. To this end, we overview the prior work on blockchain-based smart grids.

There is a clear consensus on the drivers of CC activities, yet disputes remain about their impact on economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. Our analysis reveals that the theories on CC have undergone fundamental changes with the emergence of new empirical models. We provide an integrated framework to synthesize the research topics and proposed an agenda for further investigation.}

The global environmental impact of China is such that there is an urgent need for improved environmental accountability in China. The paper uses a theoretical model based on the work of Michel Foucault on episteme change as well as Systems Theory. Interviews and surveys are analysed using qualitative thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. There is evidence that the Chinese accountants were influenced by the ancient philosophies of Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism. In turn, this influence results in a deep reverence for Nature and a strong desire for harmony between humans and Nature. The conclusion is that the Chinese accountants do have a strong environmental ethic derived from their beliefs and that this supports their roles in providing environmental accountability and hence sustainability. Conducting research in China was difficult and the number and quality of the interviews are limited because of this. Furthermore there were problems associated with interpretation and translation across languages and cultures. Nonetheless, this research has the potential to help empower Chinese accountants to improve their environmental accountability. Much research has already focused on Chinese business and traditional Chinese philosophy but this study contributes to the knowledge and understanding of the relations between Chinese accountants, environmental accountability and ancient belief systems. As such, the study makes an important contribution to Chinese, and hence global, sustainability.}

A deep learning-based cloud is utilized at the application layer of the proposed infrastructure to resolve communication latency and centralization, scalability. It enables cost-effective, high-performance computing resources for smart city applications such as the smart industry, smart transportation.

Moreover, the insertion of blockchain technology in the energy market can provide significant advances in the commercialization of electric energy, enabling virtual transactions to be conducted in a decentralized and secure way, managing numerous smart contracts, and contributing reasonably to introducing prosumers in energy transactions in MGs. This systematic review enabled us to shed more light and direct the study methodology to answer the questions surrounding this research. The aspects found explore concepts similar to the characteristics of TE and MGs exposed in the review of indicators. It was possible to perceive that the research strategy was successfully employed and has considerable academic significance, especially in this theme. Additionally, a new approach to the topic was presented by analyzing the interactions of prosumers and utility. The sustainable aspect related to MGs communities is highlighted because of the self-supply of smart homes and the use of RES.}

However, these cities are burdened with issues like handling urban wastes, conserve fossil fuels, facilitating affordable and timely healthcare systems, providing efficient traffic management, and transparency in governance. These concerns gave birth to the innovative, technology-based, and sustainable urban spaces called Sustainable Smart City (SSC). SSC experiments deploy technologies to monitor its community and provide sustainable and affordable solutions. SSC employs the technologies to monitor its community and provide sustainable and affordable solutions to the urban spaces.

AI and 5G, through emerging technologies such as blockchain, gene editing, Internet of Things sensors, nanotechnology, or 3D printing accelerate a blurring of boundaries between digital, biological, and physical spheres. In this editorial, we introduce the term boundary object, or boundary technology, that can help process more information (syntactic boundary) for enhanced learning (semantic boundary) and that can create a higher-level intelligence (pragmatic boundary). Boundary objects are also a means of representing, learning about, and transforming knowledge at a given boundary. We propose that crossing syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic boundaries is facilitated by three FIR phenomena (big data, machine learning, and AI). Each of these phenomena possesses a unique capability (processing, learning, and adaptation) to help communities learn about their differences and dependences. We also show how the six articles in this special issue are related to boundary and sphere challenges, and we provide an overview of directions for future research. All in all, marketing scholars should focus on enhancing their abilities in knowledge integration across boundaries to sustain their role as cutting-edge scientists.}

abstract = {Based on a set of universally accepted cooperative principles, cooperatives stand out as promoting equality, community development and their members' well-being. Therefore, this study aims to understand which factors influence cooperators' satisfaction. The research adopted a quantitative methodology with the data-collecting instrument being based on a questionnaire applied to 194 cooperators belonging to wine cooperatives in the Dão region of Portugal. The results indicate that the economic factors used to measure members' satisfaction do not predict this. Rather, the factors most related to cooperative members’ satisfaction concern compatibility among members, partner selection, human resources, power and control, as well as the development of the organisations, communities and their members. Cooperative development is influenced by factors of a social and human order and the implementation of policies that may be directed towards a more economic and business-like aspect may itself affect satisfaction within these organisations. Implications for theory and practice are also suggested.}

The present work examined the simultaneous impact of two key stress factors, drought and spider mite attack (Tetranychus urticae) in Medicago truncatula plants. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipid peroxidation (MDA content) and proline content in well-watered and drought-stressed leaves infested by spider mites along with neighboring leaves were examined in order to investigate the local and systemic effect of the two stresses on the antioxidant and osmoprotective response. High levels of lipid peroxidation were recorded in plants under drought stress and plants under combined drought stress and spider mite feeding compared with control plants. Hydrogen peroxide biosynthesis was significantly induced in plants under drought and spider mite attack, with highest levels detected in the feeding leaf (local response). Proline was accumulated in drought stressed-plants, with the highest levels observed in plants exposed to a combination of drought stress and mite feeding. RT-qPCR expression analysis of key genes implicated in ROS metabolism (PAO, DAO, AOX, CuZnSOD, FeSOD, MnSOD) and proline biosynthesis (P5CR, P5CS) pointed to different patterns of regulation between abiotic and biotic stress, as well as their combination. Exposure of plants to both drought stress and attack by spider mites mainly affected the local antioxidant and osmoprotective response of Medicago truncatula, highlighting the relative significance of drought-induced phenomena in combined drought/mite infestation stress responses.}

abstract = {A smart contract is an electronic transaction protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation and execution of the terms of an underlying legal contract designed to fulfil common contractual conditions comprising payments, legal obligations, and enforcement without third parties. Thus, by following the traditional perception, smart contracts target to reduce transaction costs including arbitration and enforcement costs by realising trackable and irreversible transactions by using blockchain technology for distributed databases. However, the potential of smart contracts goes far beyond cost reductions by facilitating the entrepreneurial collaboration of cross-organisational business-processes that are characteristic for smart supply chains. A closer look to existing or ongoing smart contract projects reveals that the majority of smart-contract applications in business life are linked to supply chain management, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 solutions. The author participated in several EU projects related to transnational entrepreneurial networks and smart supply chains. Thus, the paper discusses the research question of how and to which extent smart contracting and blockchain technology can facilitate the implementation of collaborative business structures for sustainable entrepreneurial activities in smart supply chains. The research is based on expert interviews, surveys and case studies, which took place in the context of the EU projects with a focus on the Baltic Sea Region.}

abstract = {This chapter examines the integration of GS1 standards with the functional components of blockchain technology as an approach to realize a coherent standardized framework of industry-based tools for successful food supply chains (FSCs) transformation. The globalization of food systems has engendered significant changes to the operation and structure of FSCs. Alongside increasing consumer demands for safe and sustainable food products, FSCs are challenged with issues related to information transparency and consumer trust. Uncertainty in matters of transparency and trust arises from the growing information asymmetry between food producers and food consumers, in particular, how and where food is cultivated, harvested, processed, and under what conditions. FSCs are tasked with guaranteeing the highest standards in food quality and food safety—ensuring the use of safe and authentic ingredients, limiting product perishability, and mitigating the risk of opportunism, such as quality cheating or falsification of information. A sustainable, food-secure world will require multidirectional sharing of information and enhanced information symmetry between food producers and food consumers. The need for information symmetry will drive transformational changes in FSCs methods of practice and will require a coherent standardized framework of best practice recommendations to manage logistic units in the food chain. A standardized framework will enhance food traceability, drive FSC efficiencies, enable data interoperability, improve data governance practices, and set supply chain identification standards for products and assets (what), exchange parties (who), locations (where), business processes (why), and sequence (when).}

abstract = {Background
Modern food supply chains are complex and contain numerous stakeholders, with each performing specific roles pertaining to food production. As food supply chains become more complex, the importance of food production transparency increases. Several factors contribute to the need for transparency such as an increase in the global population, detection of foodborne illness outbreaks, efficient management of risks and recalls, and satisfying consumer demand. A case in point is the necessity that food production systems become more sustainable through improvements in production efficiency and reducing the wasting of resources and food. Other examples include the need for timely identification of the source of food production, in addition to requiring a more rapid knowledge of the cause of contamination during outbreaks of foodborne illness.
Scope and approach
This review sets out to describe enabling technologies, provided by the Internet of Things (IoT), which have the potential to increase food production transparency. In addition, other technologies important for managing and using food supply chain data, such as blockchain and Big Data analytics, are reviewed. The IoT is the overarching technology which allows for data collection from multiple phases within supply chains leading to data driven transparent systems of food production.
Key findings and conclusions
Enabling transparency in food supply chains via implementation of technologies will require considerable effort from all stakeholders involved, resulting in many new challenges and requirements that must be addressed. These challenges and requirements range from technical issues, such as Internet connection, storage requirements, device security, and government requirements and regulations, to those concerning consumer acceptance.}
