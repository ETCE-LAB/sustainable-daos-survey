The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this paper, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of decentralized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review of the strategy adopted for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of blockchain networks in a broad area of telecommunication. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2896108","Wallenberg AI.

To maintain a canonical state of blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block of transactions through a process of “block mining” by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a proof-of-work based blockchain network, which is constrained by the computing resource and deployed as an infrastructure for decentralized data management applications. Due to the competition among miners in the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing service provider.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2019.2900238","WASP/NTU M4082187(grant numbers:4080); Singapore MOE Tier 1(grant numbers:2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17); MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15); Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore EMA Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666727","Blockchain;auction;cloud/fog computing;social welfare;pricing;proof of work;game theory","Blockchain;Resource management;Protocols;Cryptography;Task analysis;Peer-to-peer computing;Approximation algorithms","cloud computing;computational complexity;cryptocurrencies;data mining;distributed databases;electronic commerce;mobile computing;resource allocation;tendering","resource allocation;cloud/fog computing;decentralized secure data management platform;multidemand bidding scheme;constant-demand bidding scheme;decentralized data management applications;auction-based market model;block mining;proof-of-work based consensus protocols;public blockchain networks;auction mechanism","","129","","43","IEEE","13 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature.

Autonomous data collection, exchange, and processing across different network segments with minimal human interventions in space-air-ground IoT (SAG-IoT) can bring great convenience to consumers, however, it also suffers new attacks from intruders. Severe privacy invasion, reliability issues, and security breaches of SAG-IoT can hinder its wide deployment. The emerging blockchain holds great potentials to address the security concerns in SAG-IoT, thanks to its prominent features of decentralization, transparency, immutability, traceability, and auditability. Despite of the benefits of blockchain-empowered SAG-IoT, there exist a series of fundamental challenges in terms of efficiency and regulation due to the intrinsic characteristics of SAG-IoT (e.g., heterogeneity, time-variability, and poor interoperability) and the limitations of existing blockchain approaches (e.g., capacity and scalability).

The InBlock is implemented as a set of blockchain's smart contracts in Ethereum, and it implements all the functions needed for the management of a global pool of addresses without any human intervention. Any entity may request an allocation of addresses to the InBlock registry by performing a (crypto)currency transfer to the InBlock. The fee required, along with the annual renewal fee, serves as a mechanism to deter stockpiling and other wasteful practices. As with any novel technology, there are many open questions about the usage of blockchains to build an IP address registry.

However, a rather large percentage of e-waste in India is still not regulated and it runs vastly by unorganized sectors.

In this paper we explore to what extent disruptive blockchain technologies can be used to incentivise the democratic participation of citizen. The investigated approach extends the standard IoT cycle 1) sense data, 2) cloudify and elaborate them, and 3) push information to the users. Here, the user takes an active role by means of data-informed votes on policies, therefore influencing behaviours. We illustrate such an approach by means of a proof-of-concept decentralised application (dApp) supporting the negotiation of polices for the management of urban water resources. The dApp consists of a smart contract that manages the execution of other smart contracts (the policies) according to the data-driven choices of the community. This use case demonstrates how suitably blockchain technologies can support fair and safe access to data and user engagement in smart cities.","","978-1-7281-3345-4","10.1109/SA47457.2019.8938093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938093","Smart cities;Blockchain technologies;IoT;dApps;Smart Contracts","Smart contracts;Water resources;Blockchain;Smart cities;Proposals","cloud computing;decision making;Internet;Internet of Things;network theory (graphs);traffic engineering computing;water resources","smart contract;smart city;data-informed votes;urban water resources;standard IoT cycle;disruptive blockchain technologies","","3","","27","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, `megatrends' such as globalization, demographic change, and increasing digitalization are key drivers of flux in the areas of people, technology, and organization and thus also have an impact on laboratory education, especially in the field of engineering. These fast moving changes require that prospective workers as well as teachers possess a higher level of independency and responsibility. This raises the question how the related needed self-learning competencies can be nurtured and developed during study time. The paper presents first results of a qualitative evaluation of a redesigned laboratory course for prospective technology teachers based on essential principles of modern laboratory didactics in order to allow students to experiment more actively and learn in a more self-directed way. As evaluation method, guided expert interviews were chosen as the most appropriate approach. The main result is that self-directed laboratory learning helps students to learn taking over more responsibility for their own learning processes and successes. Moreover, it can increase students' motivation to learn. Finally, to reduce students' attendance obligation and to foster self-directed learning as a precondition for lifelong learning, the deployment and implementation of VISIR, a remotely accessible online experimentation facility, will take place during the first quarter of 2019. The paper closes with further research questions on the digital transformation and its impact on designing online experimentation learning by deploying cyber-physical `remotification'.","","978-1-7281-3637-0","10.1109/EXPAT.2019.8876476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8876476","self-directed learning;redesigning a lab course;qualitative evaluation;cyber-physical laboratories;digital transformation;online experimentation","Interviews;Organizations;Engineering education;Globalization;Media","computer aided instruction;educational courses;engineering education;Internet;laboratories;student experiments;technology management","laboratory education;laboratory edu-action;prospective technology teachers;cyber-physical remotification;laboratory courses;engineering education;self-learning competencies;evaluation method;self-directed laboratory learning;lifelong learning;lab course redesign;laboratory didactics;VISIR;online experimentation facility","","1","","19","IEEE","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the reliability measurement characteristics is data ownership. The authority sharing data authorizes its quality and is also responsible for the wrong decision triggered by incorrect data. The consensus-based crowdsourcing data contribute to aggregated streamflow records’ generation. The aggregated streamflow records are stored on a streamflow ledger, a Hyperledger fabric-based ledger for rivers’ streamflow data. In contrast, InterPlanery File System (IPFS) distributed file storage system is helpful for policy documents and distribution scheme storage.

To cope with this scope and complexity, many DSP texts are often organized around the “numerical examples” of a communication system. With such organization, readers can see through the complexity of DSP, they learn about the distinct concepts and protocols in one part of the communication system while seeing the big picture of how all parts fit together. From a pedagogical perspective, our personal experience has been that such approach indeed works well. Based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and research, Digital Signal Processing: a breadth-first approach is written with the reader in mind. The book is intended for a course on digital signal processing, for seniors and undergraduate students. The subject has high popularity in the field of electrical and computer engineering, and the authors consider all the needs and tools used in analysis and design of discrete time systems for signal processing. Key features of the book include: • The extensive use of MATLAB based examples to illustrate how to solve signal processing problems.

Consumers want to spend money on environmentally friendly products, but they are seldomly informed of the environmental contributions of the suppliers. Meanwhile, each supplier seeks to recover the costs for the environmental contributions to re-invest them into further contributions. Instead, in most current supply chains, the reward for each supplier is not clearly defined and fairly distributed. To address these issues, we propose a supply-chain contribution management platform for fair reward distribution called ‘Advanced Ledger.’ This platform records suppliers' environ-mental contribution trails, receives rewards from consumers in exchange for trail-backed fungible tokens, and fairly distributes the rewards to each supplier based on the contribution trails. In this paper, we overview the architecture of Advanced Ledger and 11 technical features, including decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) based contribution verification, contribution concealment, negative-valued tokens, fair reward distribution, atomic rewarding, and layer-2 rewarding. We then study the requirements and candidates of the smart contract platforms for implementing Advanced Ledger. Finally, we introduce a use case called ‘ESG token’ built on the Advanced Ledger architecture.","","978-1-6654-6104-7","10.1109/Blockchain55522.2022.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9881842","supply;chain;blockchain;tokenization;rewarding;decentralization;scalability;privacy","Supply chain management;Costs;Decentralized autonomous organization;Atomic layer deposition;Smart contracts;Current supplies;Blockchains","blockchains;consumer behaviour;contracts;costing;investment;supply chain management;supply chains","smart contract platforms;atomic rewarding;DAO;ledger architecture;ESG token;decentralized autonomous organization;trail-backed fungible tokens;environmental contributions;environmentally friendly products;supply chain management systems;fair reward distribution","","","","64","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While routing coordinates network data flows, economic flows can be coordinated by smart contracts built over a local distributed ledger. We define crowdsourced networks, the concept, architecture, and implementation using a local Ethereum PoA blockchain with Solidity smart contracts that compensate the data traffic contribution and consumption recorded by a traffic monitoring system, on a wireless mesh network. The prototype software has been validated in a controlled mesh network environment. Functional tests show its ability to account and route economic flows with small resource consumption, and therefore confirms these networks can develop organically by the addition of consumer and provider participants to reach the typical scale of most wireless mesh access networks and deliver networking services that aim to be socially and economically sustainable.","","978-1-7281-6978-1","10.1109/DAPPS49028.2020.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9126018","smart contracts, service pricing, mesh networks, reliable monitoring, crowdsourcing, blockchain","Wireless communication;Mesh networks;Smart contracts;Wireless mesh networks;Urban areas;Decentralized applications;Blockchains","contracts;crowdsourcing;cryptocurrencies;Internet;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;wireless mesh networks","prototype software;functional tests;data flows;routing coordinates network;networking services;wireless mesh access networks;provider participants;resource consumption;route economic flows;controlled mesh network environment;traffic monitoring system;data traffic contribution;solidity smart contracts;local Ethereum PoA blockchain;crowdsourced networks;local distributed ledger;network data;Internet access;content services;infrastructures connectivity offer;local development;crowdsourced networking infrastructures;social participation;universal connectivity;crowdsourced connectivity;contract networking","","","","16","IEEE","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More recently, the Business Roundtable, a business group of more than 200 members, including the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase, Amazon, and General Motors, and of a combined annual revenue of US$7 trillion, published a statement of purpose calling for a significant departure from the dogma that businesses should serve only the owners of capital.1 Companies should “protect the environment” and treat workers with “dignity and respect,” the statement said. Without doubt there is growing awareness in corporate America and elsewhere that Milton Friedman's philosophy of businesses caring only for maximizing value for their shareholders is outdated. We now live in a different world. The threat to life on our planet due to climate change requires corporate leaders to think long term and not just of the next quarterly results. Millennials and younger generations are more sensitive to issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability and often boycott brands seen to be all about healthy balance sheets and little else.2 Moreover, there is considerable pressure for reforming corporate purpose from politicians, especially as corporate profits soar and many companies opt to spend those profits on share buybacks instead of improving worker wages.","","9780262360111","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9311710.pdf&bkn=9286257&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","","31 Dec 2020","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

Also known as “social sensor” and “social IoT”, these individuals and communities generate a huge volume of social signals, which has shown prominent value for mining. These unstructured social signals provide a new perspective in the research of complex systems, which makes the traditional cyber–physical system (CPS)-oriented information computing sublimate to the cyber–physical–social system (CPSS)-oriented knowledge computing. However, there still exist great uncertainties, ambiguities, and complexities in modeling behaviors of social individuals or groups. Especially when we apply big-data-driven learning-based models in specific fields and scenarios, the lack of domain expert knowledge and characteristics of system uncertainty severely limits the performance and accuracy of these models. The introduction of fuzzy system modeling integrates data and knowledge in the social computing area, which has shown its unique advantages in solving the above issues and has drawn more attention to this topic. In this article, we conduct a review of recent advances in social computing with fuzzy technologies in CPSS. First, we briefly review the development of social computing, and analyze the characteristics and advantages of social computing through fuzzy methods. Second, we refine core fuzzy system methods for social computing and elaborate on existing fuzzy-technology-empowered social computing methodologies. As in a range of social spaces, we also review and analyze related advances in human-in-the-loop systems. We also reveal the trend of decentralized, autonomous, and organized computing in cyber–physical–social space with fuzzy-based methods and proposed a framework to categorize related studies in CPSS.

With a focus on the two last aspects, the amount of intelligent devices being connected in a scattered way to the existing power grid is ever-growing. Nevertheless, guaranteeing a cyber-secure and resilient control of these IoE components as well as a seamless and reliable delivery of electricity services, such as renewable energy exchange, electric vehicles charging, demand response, and so forth; might be the bottleneck of current power systems that are largely still functioning following a centralized approach. Thus, the future power grid would gradually incorporate a growing number of distributed-based control schemes to deal with this challenge. And many believe that blockchain could be a key-enabler in this transition, due to its consistent characteristics with multiple requirements of future power systems. In this paper, we provide an extensive state-of-the-art of blockchain-based additions to the IoE. Where, we first introduce various concepts related to blockchain and discuss the rationale behind its adoption in the context of IoE. Then, differently from the existing body of literature surveys, we do not only provide a taxonomy and evaluate a wide range of recent research outputs that integrated blockchain within modern power systems. But we also draw some valuable lessons learned for each studied category and discuss the intersection of blockchain with various emerging paradigms that have the potential of radically impacting the smart grid. In addition, we present some real-world industrial initiatives and ongoing projects built on top of blockchain, dedicated for offering diverse electricity services with a case study of a pilot project on energy trading in Amsterdam. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and worthwhile opportunities of deploying blockchain in this particular area, with a focus on the aspect of operational cyber-security.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3212148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9911641","Blockchain;cryptocurrency;electric vehicles;energy trading;internet of energy;privacy;security;smart contract;smart grid","Blockchains;Indexes;Smart grids;Reliability;Privacy;Power system reliability;Peer-to-peer computing;Electric vehicles;Energy management;Smart contracts;Cryptocurrency","","","","","","134","CCBY","5 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Creating automated organizations is only but a first step towards the goal. We decided to make an art organization which sells art to make money. The standard way of doing that would be to create a web platform like Amazon (controlled by humans) that sells art and let human artists upload their artwork. But in the interest of keeping this as automated as possible; we have decided to make a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which generates art.

Token economy, however, is a newly born notion that may have great potential in stimulating coordination to be more valuable and efficient. This article classifies enterprise alliances into two categories based on their participation motivations and operating modes. Research has been conducted on ten industries facing the pressure of digitalization to analyze participation motivations and operating modes in enterprise alliances. This research has found that cooperative enterprise alliances tend to have relatively negative attitudes and pursue open and fair coordination. On the contrary, competitive enterprise alliances tend to have relatively positive attitudes and pursue secure and efficient coordination. Therefore, models for cooperative enterprise alliances utilize the blockchain and token economy to encourage open resource sharing and ensure fair benefits. In contrast, models for cooperative enterprise alliances utilize the blockchain and token economy to alleviate unfair advantages and encourage efficient resource sharing. This research has also recognized that the value of tokens lies in obtaining future resources, exchanging for monetary resources, and making rules in DAO. Moreover, the integration of token economy could improve corporate innovation capability and promote sustainable development of enterprise alliances. The main contribution of this article is the design of two stimulative coordination models for cooperative and competitive enterprise alliances based on their differences and the token economy. The significance of this paper is to provide a guideline for corporations to share resources and create value efficiently in enterprise alliances and help enterprise alliances operate and develop more sustainably using blockchain technology.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3169598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761929","Blockchain applications;coordination;enterprise alliances;smart contracts;token economy","Blockchains;Biological system modeling;Resource management;Technological innovation;Sustainable development;Tokenization","innovation management;organisational aspects;project management;sustainable development","stimulative coordination models;competitive enterprise alliances;token economy;participation motivations;operating modes;contrary enterprise alliances;help enterprise alliances operate","","","","99","CCBY","22 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It involves supplying, borrowing, or staking crypto assets to earn an income in forms of transaction fees, interest, or participation rewards at different defi marketplaces. In this systematic survey, we present yield farming protocols as an aggregation-layer constituent of the wider defi ecosystem that interact with primitive-layer protocols such as dex and plf. We examine the yield farming mechanism by first studying the operations encoded in the yield farming smart contracts, and then performing stylized, parameterized simulations on various yield farming strategies. We conduct a thorough literature review on related work, and establish a framework for yield farming protocols that takes into account pool structure, accepted token types, and implemented strategies. Using our framework, we characterize major yield aggregators in the market including Yearn Finance, Beefy, and Badger DAO. Moreover, we discuss anecdotal attacks against yield aggregators and generalize a number of risks associated with yield farming.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3222815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9953979","Decentralized Finance (DeFi);yield farming;yield aggregator;simulation;blockchain","Protocols;Farming;Finance;Blockchains;Ecosystems;Decentralized applications;Compounds","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture of blockchain enhances these applications by providing strong security and trust-oriented guarantees, such as immutability, verifiability, and decentralization. Despite these incredible features that blockchain technology brings to these ICT applications, recent research has indicated that the strong guarantees are not sufficient enough and blockchain networks may still be prone to various security, privacy, and reliability issues. In order to overcome these issues, it is important to identify the anomalous behaviour within the actionable time frame. In this article, we provide an in-depth survey regarding integration of anomaly detection models in blockchain technology. For this, we first discuss how anomaly detection can aid in ensuring security of blockchain based applications. Then, we demonstrate certain fundamental evaluation metrics and key requirements that can play a critical role while developing anomaly detection models for blockchain. Afterwards, we present a thorough survey of various anomaly detection models from the perspective of each layer of blockchain. Finally, we conclude the article by highlighting certain important challenges alongside discussing how they can serve as future research directions for new researchers in the field.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2022.3205643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9887797","Blockchain;Anomaly Detection;Fraud Detection","Blockchains;Anomaly detection;Security;Smart contracts;Privacy;Bitcoin;Tutorials","","","","","","","IEEE","12 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We argue that circular causality, the generalized feedback mechanism for complex and purposive systems, should be adapted as the fundamental principle for control and management of metasystems with metacomplexity in metaverses. Particularly, an interdisciplinary approach is suggested for MetaControl and DeControl as a new form of intelligent control based on five control metaverses: Meta Verses, MultiVerses, InterVerses, TransVerse, and Deep Verses.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2022.106022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9915522","MetaControl;MetaSystems;Metaverses;CPSS;DAO;DeControl;Prescriptive Control;Parallel Control;Computational Control;Knowledge Automation;Control Intelligence;Parallel Intelligence","","cyber-physical systems;feedback;intelligent control;Internet;knowledge management;parallel processing;security of data","complex systems;computational control;control intelligence;control metaverses;control philosophy;cyber-physical-social systems;DeControl;intelligent control;knowledge automation;metacontrol;metasystems;parallel control systems;parallel philosophy;prescriptive control;prescriptive knowledge","","3","","61","","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, much attention has been paid to its entertainment and social functions. Considering the openness and interoperability of metaverses, the market of quality inspection promises explosive growth. In this paper, taking advantage of metaverses, we first propose the concept of Automated Quality Inspection (AutoQI), which performs integrated inspection covering the entire manufacturing process, including Quality of Materials, Quality of Manufacturing (QoM), Quality of Products, Quality of Processes (QoP), Quality of Systems, and Quality of Services (QoS). Based on the scenarios engineering theory, we discuss how to perform interactions between metaverses and the physical world for virtual design instruction and physical validation feedback. Then we introduce a bottomup inspection device development workflow with productivity tools offered by metaverses, making development more effective and efficient than ever. As the core of quality inspection, we propose Quality Transformers to complete detection task, while federated learning is integrated to regulate data sharing. In summary, we point out the development directions of quality inspection under metaverse tide.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2022.106091","Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:2021402011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9970440","Automated Optical Inspection;Metaverses;Quality Inspection;Transformers","","","","","","","31","","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, this survey aims to realize this vision through the organic integration of 6G-enabled edge artificial intelligence (AI) and Metaverse. Specifically, we first introduce three new types of edge-Metaverse architectures that use 6G-enabled edge AI to solve resource and computing constraints in Metaverse. Then we summarize technical challenges that these architectures face in Metaverse and the existing solutions.
