abstract = {This study proposes the relationship between carbon trading and blockchain and moves forward to find solutions to the major problem of reduction of carbon footprint on our planet. The “Kyoto Protocol '' of 1997 introduced the need for a mechanism to trade grants issued, allowing the restricted emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and creating an ecosystem for trading the surplus and deficiency of these credits/grants. This study aims at making this trade fraud free by using the powerful features of the blockchain like that of decentralization and a trustless environment by using different smart contracts that operate between multiple stakeholders in the ecosystem, the first contract creates a distributed ledger register for stakeholders, next quantifies CO2 consumptions and mints carbon tokens, third helps in verification of CO2 consumptions and the final contract is a DAO for voting on governance issues. Thus, this work proposes a blockchain based solution for trading of carbon credits to solve the problem of climate change.},

abstract = {Climate change has negative effects on life on earth as well as the environment and economy. Harmful greenhouse gases, especially CO2, emitted from industrial processes executed by developed countries were identified as the primary reason behind climate change. The world recognized the risk of excessive CO2 emissions, therefore, the United Nations established the Kyoto protocol which aims at reducing the release of CO2 by monetizing its emissions. To achieve its goal, the Kyoto protocol established a carbon emission trading scheme to distribute and trade CO2 allowances among and between emitting participants. However, the carbon emission trading scheme fell short of its goal due to lack of integrity, governance, high intermediary cost and other security and technical issues revealing the need for a solution to elevate the scheme's operations. Meanwhile, blockchian emerged as a revolutionary way to operate business models due to its decentralization, security, traceability, immutability, and privacy. This study proposes an efficient and smart carbon emission trading system utilizing blockchain and smart contract. Our paper proposes a carbon emission trading system using Ethereum blockchain smart contract to automate trading Kyoto units between entities and reduce operations cost. The proposed system performs buyers registration and Kyoto units trading using Ether cryptocurrency for payment without intermediary but rather through smart contract and blockchain. The result is a robust and smart system that inherits blockchain features of trust, immutability, distribution, governance, and transparency.},

abstract = {Climate change represents a serious threat to the health of our planet and imposed a discussion upon energy waste and production. In this paper we propose a smart grid architecture relying on blockchain technology aimed at discouraging the production and distribution of non-renewable energy as the one derived from fossil fuel. Our model relies on a reverse application of a recently introduced attack to the blockchain based on chain forking. Our system involves both a central authority and a number of distributed peers representing the stakeholders of the energy grid. This system preserves those advantages derived from the blockchain and it also address some limitations such as energy waste for mining operations. In addition, the reverse attack we rely on allows to mitigate the behavior of a classic blockchain, which is intrinsecally self-regulated, and to trigger a sort of ethical action which penalizes non-renewable energy producers. Blacklisted stakeholders will be induced to provide their transaction with higher fees in order to preserve the selling rate.},

abstract = {Climate change has put significant pressure on energy markets. Political decisions such as the plan of the German government to shut down coal power plants by 2038 are shifting electricity production towards renewable and distributed energy resources. The share of these resources will continue to grow significantly in the coming years. This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade ﬂexibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these ﬂexibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy ﬂexibilities without any intermediary or central instance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an implementation of a prototype of the proposed markets based on the Ethereum blockchain and provide a detailed evaluation of its efficiency and scalability.},

abstract = {Sustainability is a topic of increasing interest. The United Nations has released a list of 17 goals for sustainable development for the global community. Blockchain is a recent technological innovation that shows great promise in changing industries. In this paper, we look specifically at smart grids and supply chain management systems as areas where sustainable technological innovation can happen. To identify software engineering aspects of blockchain in smart grids and supply chain management, we start upon online libraries focusing on engineering and information technology, and we opted for the methodology of systematic mapping studies in software engineering. The search strategy identified 535 papers, of which 60 were identified as main studies for our mapping. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous similar studies exist. Results of the study show that the research connecting blockchain technology to smart grids and supply chain management systems is still young. None of the techniques or systems have yet been implemented in a real life setting. As such, more work has to be done before we can look at the actual implications of putting such technologies into use. Software engineering practices could prove to be very useful in the process of development. We propose that future studies can focus on bringing the technologies closer to real life implementations, as well as how to involve the end users in the development of the blockchain-based systems.},

abstract = {Blockchain networks have been claimed to have the potential of fundamentally changing the way humans perform economic transactions with each other. In such networks, trust-enabling agents and activities, that were traditionally arranged in a centralized fashion, are replaced by a network of nodes which collectively yet independently witness and establish the non-repudiability of transactions. Most often, a proof-of-work (PoW) requirement ensures that participants invest resources for joining the network, incentivizing conformance to the network rules, while making it highly infeasible for malicious agents to construct an alternative version of the transaction history. While research on security and efficiency aspects of blockchain networks is already being conducted, there is still work to be done to understand how different external and internal conditions guarantee or threaten their sustainability, i.e., their continuous operation. Focusing on public PoW-based blockchain platforms, in this paper we sketch an abstract model that is aimed at supporting comprehension and qualitative reasoning about the factors that affect sustainability of a blockchain network.},

abstract = {Blockchain is an emerging computing and development platform. It is a new paradigm that aims at empowering peers and eliminating the need for central authenticating authority. In essence, blockchain has introduced a new level of distributed sovereignty. Cryptocurrency is one prominent outcome of this new computing paradigm that has gained broad attention. However, Blockchain paradigm has demonstrated broader potential impacts in many disciplines including secure and sustainable software engineering, supply chain, banking, and peer to peer commerce. Unfortunately, the fundamentals of blockchains remain unpopular and vague. Many existing information sources on blockchain focuses on the specific application of blockchain and ignores the fundamental concepts that are largely independent of the specific applications. Moreover, emerging development platforms have significantly simplified the development of blockchain based applications, but remain unpopular and are often not well documented. Sizable communities of developers and users of such open source platforms are yet to form and stabilize. The workshop presented Susereum [7], an emerging blockchain platform that provides transparent, immutable, and permanent credit to open source developers when they contribute sustainable code fragments. The workshop covered Susereum approach and its development as an extension to Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. This provided participants with first-hand experience with blockchain-based application development.},

abstract = {Software sustainability is a systematic challenge that impacts broad segments of software systems. Software codebases must evolve overtime to address changing contexts and adapt to the flux in middlewares and platforms. In the process, it accumulates arbitrary complexities and its maintenance becomes progressively difficult.Current sustainability approaches focus on the symptoms and tend to be reactive in nature, and ignore the fundamental incentive structures that drive decision-making processes. Moreover, contemporary approaches are insensitive to the uniqueness of each software project context and operate on the assumption that sustainability measurements are universally applicable to the majority of software systems.This paper introduces a fundamentally novel peer-driven approach to managing software sustainability. The methodology ensures that software teams can define their own sustainability measures that adequately address the unique context of their project and its priorities. These measures are dynamically defined by the project peers to ensure their applicability as the project context evolves. Finally, the paper introduces Susereum, a blockchain platform that materializes the methodology and establishes novel incentive structures to systematically promote software sustainability throughout the project lifecycle.},

abstract = {In a blockchain-based system, the lack of centralized control requires active participation and cooperative behaviors of system entities to ensure system security and sustainability. However, dynamic environments and unpredictable entity behaviors challenge the performances of such systems in practice. Therefore, designing a feasible incentive mechanism to regulate entity behaviors becomes essential to improve blockchain system performance. The prosperous characteristics of blockchain can also contribute to an effective incentive mechanism. Unfortunately, current literature still lacks a thorough survey on incentive mechanisms related to the blockchain to understand how incentive mechanisms and blockchain make each other better. To this end, we propose evaluation requirements in terms of the properties and costs of incentive mechanisms. On one hand, we provide a taxonomy of the incentive mechanisms of blockchain systems according to blockchain versions, incentive forms and incentive goals. On the other hand, we categorize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms according to application scenarios and incentive goals. During the review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-art incentive mechanisms based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Through careful review, we present how incentive mechanisms and blockchain benefit with each other, discover a number of unresolved issues, and point out corresponding potential directions for future research.},

To summarize and organize the insights of research in information systems (IS) on how BCT relates to transparency and, ultimately, sustainability of supply chains, this paper conducts a structured literature review. In total 46 articles have been identified and analyzed. The analysis shows that the potential of BCT to facilitate transparency in supply chains and thus enable sustainability measures stems from its decentralized and distributed nature. Further, BCT does not unfold this potential on its own; rather it is a technology that complements existing IS used to manage inter-organizational transactions. Overall, the paper contributes to the literature by providing a deeper insight into the possibilities, features, and merits of BCT in the SCM context, mainly focusing on transparency and sustainability matters. Summarizing and organizing the advantages of BCT and the shortcomings of existing IS used in SCM as discussed in prior research, this paper emphasizes that BCT needs to be considered as a complementary technology. Viewing BCT as such and implementing at such, BCT has great potential to support sustainability efforts significantly.},

Significant indicators of "Hierarchical changes Digital Economy Real Gross Output by Industry" determining the global economic profile of Digital Economy are revealed. In the article the necessity of transformation of the economic profile of Russia in the direction of sustainability that will allow the use of promising technological approaches for the conservation and sustainable dynamics of development are proved. This is fully in line with the process of fundamental changes to achieve maximum economic growth with the use of innovative technologies, implemented within the framework of the concept of the limits of the growth of The Club of Rome. As a rule, the processes of change can be either gradual through simple improvements or more radical -- associated with structural changes. The application of radical changes is associated with the need to provide reliable, proven knowledge. Technological foresight should become less expensive, maintaining high quality. The natural candidate for this role are "Big Data", "Bitcoin", "Blockchain" -- attributes of Digital Economy.The conducted analysis of the Russian digital economy profile, based on the assessment of changes in big data "Rank &amp; Score" and ranking by "Indicator" and "Index", revealed the most sensitive elements of the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile. Big data "Global Innovation Index 2018" ("World international intellectual property organization") were used for the analysis. The cumulate analysis of big data changes "Rank &amp; Score" and ranking by "Indicator" and "Index" allowed depicting the scheme of the the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile. Considering the dominant position of big data "Indicator" - "Innovation Output Sub-index", as well as "Strength" and "Weakness", the dominant factors that determine the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile were identified. Among the subsidizing factors the most risk-taking is Domestic "credit to private sector &amp; market scale" and ICT "use &amp; business model creation" were pointed out. The Russian resource-based economy is highly dependent on foreign capital and technology, especially at the stage of changing over from the fifth to the sixth wave of the Kondratiev wave. At the same time the blockchain of the Russian digital economy profile highlights the essential role of Tertiary "education &amp; enrolment". Most Russian firms urgently need addition to the stock human (intellectual) capital.

The blockchain-based system allows cyclists to receive financial compensation from organizations, such as city governments or local businesses, that would like to sponsor cyclists. Using bicycle-powered sensors, cyclists collect and redeem their activity data through smart contracts stored and executed on an Ethereum blockchain. The use of blockchain technology makes transactions secure, trustworthy, and timely.This project envisions expanding this data platform to include additional bicycle-based sensors that cyclists use to collect and sell data, monetizing their commuting habits, and building a scalable and stable solution for encouraging sustainable transportation in cities.},

As proof of concept, the blockchain technology is introduced in a smart community where consumers take part in energy trading among themselves as well as with the utility. In this paper, three use cases for P2P energy trading in a private blockchain network is discussed. The blockchain architecture is developed using the Hyperledger framework and the smart contracts are defined in the chaincode. The performance of the blockchain network on resource constrained IoT system based on Raspberry Pi is also evaluated.},

Such networks carry the promise of highly decentralized validation and witnessing of important social and economic events, reducing the need to rely on centralized authorities. Public proof-of-work based networks specifically, despite their limitations and challenges, continue to be popular due to their simplicity and intuitiveness. However, for such networks to perpetually meet viability, efficiency, security and environmental sustainability objectives, they need to adapt to environmental changes via continuous reconfiguration of their operating parameters. In this paper, we attempt to formulate this blockchain network adaptability problem as one of control engineering. We sketch the basic characteristics of blockchain networks as systems and identify variables available for designing a controller that allows such networks to attain macroscopic operating objectives. By means of describing and simulating a simple idealized proportional controller, we demonstrate the benefits and some of the challenges in designing such controllers.},

abstract = {Data storage in peer-to-peer (P2P) games in a perfect applications scenario for blockchain. However, suffering from high transaction cost and latency, proof-of-work (PoW) becomes the bottleneck of blockchain games. Many attempts have been made to overcome various limitations of blockchain for P2P games, but many of them require modifying the game itself to be compatible with a blockchain solution. These overheads often bring new undesirable results to deal with. In this paper, we propose Proof-of-Play, a novel consensus model, to address these issues with a blockchain naturally integrated with P2P games, with minimum intervene to the game. The ultimate goal is to create a secure and fully decentralized architecture to transform a game being community-sustainable.},

Due to ever shorter innovation cycles, especially in the field of consumer electronics, more and more electrical waste is being produced. Motivated by this fact we decided to face this challenge in a course called programming project course. There we introduced the problem and further the blockchain technology. The task was to design a blockchain-based solution to reduce Waste Electrical &amp; Electronic Equipment (WEE) and so to improve sustainability. The final idea here was to establish a deposit system for WEE. In this paper, we present the programming project from the development process of the first ideas to the completion of the running prototype and discuss the results.},

abstract = {Research software has opened up new pathways of discovery in many and diverse disciplines. This research software is developed under unique budgetary and schedule constraints. Its development is driven by knowledge discovery goals often without documented requirements. As a result, the software code quality is impacted which often hinders its sustainability beyond the immediate research goals. More importantly, the prevalent reward structures favor contributions in terms of research articles and systematically undervalues research codes contributions. As a result, researchers and funding agencies do not allocate appropriate efforts or resources to the development, sustenance, and dissemination of research codebases. This paper presents Susereum, a Blockchain based platform that aims at achieving two goals. First, restructuring prevalent incentives by awarding permanent immutable credit to research code authors similar to the credit awarded to the authors of scientific articles. Second, distributing sovereignty by empowering peers through a consensus process to define code sustainability and impact metrics.},

abstract = {Smart grid, as a new paradigm of the traditional grid, was proposed to find an effective way to integrate green and renewable energy technologies. In this model, the Internet-connected smart grid is also known as the Internet of Energy, which is also an innovative method to ensure the sharing of energy data anytime and anywhere, and ultimately build a sustainable society. However, integrating and coordinating the large and growing number of connections is a challenging problem for the traditional centralized grid system. Therefore, the smart grid architecture is changing from the centralized structure to the decentralized structure. Besides, due to its excellent characteristics, blockchain technology has been widely used in various scenarios of Smart Grid. Therefore, this article aims to review the research and application of blockchain technology in smart grid industry. Firstly, we identify the major security challenges in smart grid scenarios that the blockchain can deal with. Then, we introduce some of the latest research work based on blockchain and propose security issues in the field of smart grid in different works of literature. Finally, we discuss the main research challenges and future research directions for applying blockchain to smart grid.},

abstract = {In recent times, there has been a considerable increase in Cloud-Based applications and infrastructure. This has led to quicker innovations, agile businesses, availability of new services over the internet, improved collaboration, and better security. With the growth of new technologies like blockchain, quantum computing, mobility-focused applications, and edge computing, there has been an increased interest in adopting cloud services. In this paper, we highlight the different sustainability metrics and benefits while migrating workloads from the on-prem data center to the public clouds. Also, the clouds are elastic, scalable, cost-efficient, robust, and overall a better alternative to host the client applications and services. We present how the major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are continuously working on improving their infrastructure for a more energy efficient cloud. But with so many factors like the cost of cloud services, the location of the data center to name a few, it becomes quite a tedious task for the clients to select a cloud service provider when moving from their on-premise data center(s). Hence, we also briefly propose our solution that we are currently working on. The final goal is to have a cross-platform advisory that based on a wide-range of client-based inputs and a rich repository of current energy efficient clouds and their sustainability metrics, aims to provide them a detailed recommendation about their preferred cloud service provider. In case the client does not provide any such preference, the advisory should also recommend an ideal cloud service provider for their particular workload. This suggested action will be able to fulfill the client's constraints as well as provide them an energy efficient cloud along with a sustainability score. This score is indicative of how much improvement in the energy consumed and carbon footprint can be achieved through this migration to the suggested cloud.},

In the data storage stage, the combination of on chain and off chain storage mode is adopted to generate the certificate information of privacy data and upload it to the blockchain. On the premise of protecting the privacy and security of personal power consumption, the power consumption in the area is collected to realize the safe storage of private data, which provides reference for the energy dispatching of smart grid in the future.},

Proof of Work (PoW) is at the heart of blockchain's security, asset generation, and maintenance. Although simple and secure, a hash-based PoW like Bitcoin's puzzle is often referred to as "useless'', and the used intensive computations are considered "waste'' of energy. A myriad of Proof of "something'' alternatives have been proposed to mitigate energy consumption; however, they either introduced new security threats and limitations, or the "work'' remained far from being really "useful''. In this work, we introduce Proof of eXercise (PoX): a sustainable alternative to PoW where an eXercise is a real world matrix-based scientific computation problem. We provide a novel study of the properties of Bitcoin's PoW, the challenges of a more "rational'' solution as PoX, and we suggest a comprehensive approach for PoX.},

We argue that this infrastructuring work takes the form of entrepreneurial actions, which are self-initiated and primarily directed at sustaining or increasing the initiator's stake in the emerging information infrastructure. These entrepreneurial actions wrestle against the affordances of the installed base of the Blockchain infrastructure, and take the shape of engaging or circumventing activities. These activities purposefully aim at either influencing or working around the enablers and constraints afforded by the Blockchain information infrastructure, as its installed base is gaining inertia. This study contributes to our understanding of the purpose of infrastructuring, seen from the perspective of heterogeneous entrepreneurial agents. It supplements existing accounts of the "when" and "how" of infrastructure, with a lens for examining the "why" of infrastructure.},

abstract = {The rapidly increasing mobile traffic across the globe has proliferated the deployment of cellular base stations, which has, in turn, led to an increase in the power consumption and carbon footprint of the telecommunications industry. In recent times, solar-powered base stations (SPBSs) have gained much popularity in the telecom sector due to their ability to make operations more sustainable. However, some potential energy benefits rendered by the SPBSs have not yet been realized. In areas with dense base station deployment or low mobile traffic, SPBSs store surplus energy, which, in most instances, gets lost due to limited charge storage capacity of the batteries. To limit the wastage of energy, an appropriate mechanism enabling the utilization of excess energy produced by these base stations can be adopted. To this end, we model a Base Station-to-Grid (BS2G) network in which the grid can utilize surplus energy spared by the SPBSs. To overcome challenges in regards to scalability, robustness, and cost-optimization, we propose using the blockchain technology to create the BS2G network. Blockchain is a distributed ledger designed to record transactions in a transparent, lightweight, and tamper-proof manner. To make energy trade between base stations and the grid cost-effective, a game-theoretical approach has also been adopted in this paper. The proposed model simplifies the process of energy trading while also making it cost-optimal.},

However, their inherent shortcomings related to their throughput in terms of processed transactions, limit their applicability in such environments in a decentralized way as the underlying network is unable to sustain high workloads. In this paper a fully decentralized high performance consensus mechanism, named FAST, is proposed for a public blockchain. FAST is based on mapreduce paradigm for aggregating and adding transactions on blockchain blocks. FAST was implemented and evaluated in a basic blockchain prototype. A light client for FAST using IPFS, was developed to bring about a reduction in the data stored locally. The obtained results from tests conducted on the prototype depict that FAST exceeds the performance of not just other existing blockchain platforms but comes very close to the throughput of traditional electronic payment networks such as Visa.},

abstract = {Recently, data service companies analyzing IoT data to provide valuable knowledge emerge as a promising business model. To sustain such business model, the establishment of a data service platform for IoT data sharing and data service delivery becomes a necessity. Today, blockchain-based platforms are believed to be reliable but have poor system performance, considerable storage overheads and high energy consumption. MEC technology is then applied to help IoT devices participate in the blockchain network. However, the considerable loading of blockchain operations turns MEC hosts into a performance bottleneck, instead. Therefore, this paper exploits the hierarchical blockchain architecture in the proposed IoT data service platform, called HB-IoDS, to significantly reduce the storage overheads and service providing time. Furthermore, to alleviate the heavy burdens on MEC hosts, HB-IoDS provides the adaptive Proof-of-Work (APoW) consensus algorithm that derives an appropriate difficulty to achieve PoW condition according to device capability. By this mean, resource-constrained IoT devices can also perform blockchain operations which are usually regarded as energy-consuming. Finally, simulation results show that HB-IoDS outperforms existing blockchain-based platforms in terms of system performance, energy consumption, and storage costs. As a result, the proposed HB-IoDS is the most practical IoT data service platform.},

abstract = {The phenomenal successes of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have demonstrated the exciting promise of blockchain in powering a new decentralized economy. Yet, the current technologies exhibit many limitations, from the huge energy waste to the unsatisfying performance. In this talk, we will give a brief overview of the celebrated Bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW) protocol, and, then, Fractal's completely new blockchain design from networking to consensus layers, to deliver the first large-scale, high-performance, and provably-secure proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Our latest benchmark indicates that our cross-layer design can scale to 10,000+ nodes across the globe, and, under a modest bandwidth limit of 20 Mbps, sustains a stellar throughput of 3,000+ tps.The first part of the talk will focus on our new consensus protocol, called ?iChing", a pure PoS protocol that is much more energy- efficient. On one hand, iChing's design closely mimics Bitcoin, the only blockchain that stands the test of time for being secure, decentralized (scale to 10,000+ nodes), and irreversible. On the other hand,"iChing" through rigorous yet practical cryptographic design, addresses notorious security challenges in PoS such as nothing-at- stake and grinding attacks.The second part of the talk will present "BackPacker" our systematical redesign of peer-to-peer network to make permissionless and anonymous communication in the network more robust and fair. Moreover, "BackPacke" presents a new philosophy in separating application data (e.g. transaction information) from consensus data (order of transactions) to substantially reduce the disparity among the participating nodes. Through rigorous proofs and real-world benchmark, we show that "BackPacker" achieves both optimal block propagation time as well as near-optimal throughput (80% of the network-physical-limit). Finally, we will also discuss Fractal's perspective on important topics including effective governance and building decentralized applications. Some results in this talk are based on my joint work with Thang Dinh, Lei Fan, Jonathan Katz, and Phuc Thai.},

abstract = {The success of Bitcoin and Ethereum has attracted many efforts to build high-throughput blockchain systems. This paper focuses on transaction dissemination --- a rather overlooked issue in these systems. We argue that efficient transaction dissemination is the key for a blockchain system to sustain at high-throughput --- usually thousands of transactions per second --- and the existing solutions fell short at doing so.This paper presents Shrec, a novel transaction relay protocol for high-throughput blockchain systems built around a hybrid transaction hashing scheme that has a low hash collision rate, is resilient to collision attacks, and is fast to construct. Our experiments demonstrate that when propagating transactions, Shrec utilizes network efficiently: compared to alternative designs, Shrec reduces the bandwidth consumption by 60% at modest CPU overhead and improves the system throughput by up to 90%.},

abstract = {Traditional Blockchain Sharding approaches can only tolerate up to n/3 of nodes being adversary because they rely on the hyper-geometric distribution to make a failure (an adversary does not have n/3 of nodes globally but can manipulate the consensus of a Shard) hard to happen. The system must maintain a large Shard size (the number of nodes inside a Shard) to sustain the low failure probability so that only a small number of Shards may exist. In this paper, we present a new approach of Blockchain Sharding that can withstand up to n/2 of nodes being bad. We categorise the nodes into different classes, and every Shard has a fixed number of nodes from different classes. We prove that this design is much more secure than the traditional models (only have one class) and the Shard size can be reduced significantly. In this way, many more Shards can exist, and the transaction throughput can be largely increased. The improved Blockchain Sharding approach is promising to serve as the foundation for decentralised autonomous organisations and decentralised database.},

abstract = {In the digital Economy 'Data is the new oil. In the last decade technology has disrupted every filed imaginable. One such booming technology is Blockchain. A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. And once entered, the information is immutable. Ongoing projects and prior work in the fields of big data, data mining and data science has revealed how relevant data can be used to enhance products and services. There are uncountable applications and advantages of relevant data. The most valuable companies of today treat data as a commodity, which they trade and earn revenues.But use of relevant data has also drawn attention by the other non-conventional organizations and domains. To facilitate such trading, data marketplaces have emerged. In this paper we present a global data marketplace for users to easily buy and share data. The main focus of this research is to have a central data sharing platform for the recycling industry. This paper is a part of the research project "Recycling 4.0" which is focusing on sustainably improving the recycling process through exchange of information. We identify providing secure platform, data integrity and data quality as some major challenges for a data marketplace. In this paper we also explore how global data marketplace could be implemented using blockchain and similar technologies.},

The community of miners have faith in the integrity of each other to sustain the network, through mining pools remaining at a reasonable level of mining power. Blockchain's decentralized system is one of its main selling points and is a source of great attraction for users. However, when these mining pools start to grow and increase their mining power to dangerous levels it can result in a shift towards a centralized environment.

abstract = {Digital transformation and the adoption of ICT technologies in the factory of the future are growing faster and faster. In particular, data exploration methods and techniques are enabling the development of data-intensive Remote Monitoring Services for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance purposes. Remote Monitoring Services involve different actors across organizations. The Original Equipment Manufacturer explores high volume of data collected by sensors on the monitored machines to provide anomaly detection and predictive maintenance services. Insurance agencies may provide support to sustain maintenance costs. Spare parts suppliers can schedule the delivery of mechanical parts required for maintenance interventions. In this scenario, trust among participants becomes a critical issue. On the one hand, providers of anomaly detection and predictive maintenance services as well as insurance agencies must trust the way machines have been used by collecting and analysing sensors data. On the other hand, owners of monitored machines must trust the use of collected data to implement services, based on which maintenance costs are calculated. The goal of this paper is to leverage blockchain and smart contracts to ensure the required level of trust when implementing data exploration for Remote Monitoring Services. Events occurring on the monitored machines are stored as transactions in a blockchain-based system, to ensure non repudiation. Moreover, trust-demanding services are implemented as smart contracts, to guarantee the required level of trustworthiness among participants. The approach is integrated with a tool for data exploration in the digital factory, and has been validated taking into account performances and cost requirements.},

abstract = {Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy resources and improvements in battery technology. While these changes enhance sustainability and efficiency, they also create significant management challenges as the complexity of power systems increases. To tackle these challenges, decentralized Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. Within a transactive microgrid, "prosumers" (i.e., consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system. On the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from their trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the entire grid. This paper describes Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions (PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading.},

abstract = {With the growing commercial interest in blockchains, permissioned implementations have received increasing attention. Unfortunately, the BFT consensus algorithms that are the backbone of most of these blockchains scale poorly and offer limited throughput. Many state-of-the-art algorithms require a single leader process to receive and validate votes from a quorum of processes and then broadcast the result, which is inherently non-scalable. Recent approaches avoid this bottleneck by using dissemination/aggregation trees to propagate values and collect and validate votes. However, the use of trees increases the round latency, which ultimately limits the throughput for deeper trees. In this paper we propose Kauri, a BFT communication abstraction that can sustain high throughput as the system size grows, leveraging a novel pipelining technique to perform scalable dissemination and aggregation on trees. Our evaluation shows that Kauri outperforms the throughput of state-of-the-art permissioned blockchain protocols, such as HotStuff, by up to 28x. Interestingly, in many scenarios, the parallelization provided by Kauri can also decrease the latency.},

abstract = {Agriculture is the lifeline of Indian economy which contributes to 22% of the GDP, provides 58% employment, and sustains 69% of the population. However, agricultural production comes with various risk factors beyond human control. Farmers are highly exposed to risk and it is aggravated by the limited span of risk mitigation instruments such as insurance where there is a lack of participation from the private sector and the claim payout procedure is very lengthy, due to which the farmer cannot initiate new cropping activity or it is delayed. There is no proper and adequate provision of security for crops grown by Indian farmers and despite increasing vulnerability, they have not yet fully developed the capacity to mitigate risk effectively. There is a need to design innovative insurance products to balance the interests of the insurer as well as the insured. With the Prime Minister's call to be "self sufficient" or "aatmanirbhar", in this paper we present a decentralised peer-to-peer crop insurance framework which enables to overcome the current disadvantages by securing farmers' interests, eliminating intermediaries and providing a secure, standardized, and transparent system that does not hinder any information from stakeholders. Through blockchain technology, the system promotes trust in a trust less environment wherein the farmers and the private investors go into a contract. The investors pool their investments and provide cover for the farmers, thus help the nation become self sufficient and help the farmers prosper.},
